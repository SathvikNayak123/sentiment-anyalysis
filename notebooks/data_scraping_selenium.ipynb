       " 'These only supports sbc codec. I first tried this with a bluetooth transmitter that supports bluetooth 5.3. You have to manually enable the low latency mode with the touch controls, but it seems to work with this adapter.\\n\\n== Android ==\\n\\nAndroid experience seems alright. Connecting is quick. You get a notification with battery status for each bud (this battery status also shows up when paired to other devices). Touch controls are basic: track control, and pause. I\\'m only on bluetooth 5.1 here so I don\\'t think I\\'m getting the low latency feature here even when I enable it.\\n\\nAndroid offered to set up \\'Find My Device\\'. There is also the ability to ring the earbud if you lose it without enabling that. Sound is not very loud, but still would be helpful locating a misplaced bud.\\n\\nThere is a QR code to download a Xiaomi app. It takes me to their site which redirects to a US subdomain, and then to the play store app, but the play store says \"This item isn\\'t available in your country\". So much for firmware updates or toggling features from the phone I guess.\\n\\n== Physical ==\\n\\nThese have oblong silicone earbud tips. The medium looked closer to normal small size, but I still had to switch to the small for a good fit (I normally use the small size). Fit is comfortable. They are light and pretty unobtrusive. I found the light weight with the oblong tip does a good job keeping the earbud in place even though they lack positive retention.\\n\\nThe charging case with buds weighs about 41.5g. The pair of buds is only 7.6g.\\n\\n== Usage ==\\n\\nInstructions are a bit too Ikea, and then the text explanations that do exist are on different pages than the picture instructions so it is difficult to decipher them.\\n\\nLow latency mode has to be manually enabled by holding both bud\\'s touch buttons for 1.5 seconds. A 3-tone chime plays. You can\\'t turn it back off without putting them back in the case.\\n\\nThe buds seems to handle switching devices OK. I can disconnect on my phone, turn my transmitter on, and they pair to it. To get them back on the phone I have to manually connect again though. I didn\\'t find any automatic method so I don\\'t have to interact with the currently paired device though.\\n\\nThey are not the best at blocking external sounds out, but this is probably desirable in an active bud where you want to hear your surroundings.',\n",
       " 'The overall design is simple. The matte black case fends off smudges well and so do the stem buds. In the hands, both the case and the buds feel very light and somewhat cheap. But that’s not such a bad thing as the weight allows the buds to not be felt in the ear after a little while. When listening on the couch or relaxing, they are great. However, in my experience, the oval shape of the buds makes them slippery with a bit of sweat when doing light housework or walking, and I had to constantly adjust them, which is very distracting. I worry they might fall off when running or doing dynamic exercise. By the way, training or heavy sweat is not a problem due to the IPX4 rating.\\n\\nThe buds paired easily with my Android phone using the fast pair feature. Bluetooth 5.3 allowed the buds to stay connected at decent distances without hiccups. The touch controls worked well for the most part, but I am disappointed that there seems to be no volume option. The 5-hour battery life is pretty good for a day’s on-off regular use, but for those extended listening sessions, the quick charge feature adds over 1.5 hours in just 10 minutes of charging. The case adds up to 28 hours. There is no wireless charging option and there is no USB-C cord included.\\n\\nAlthough there is no active noise cancellation, by choosing the proper included tips, a good amount of noise is blocked and not a problem when playing. The call quality is more than decent, as I heard clearly, and even the wind was barely an issue. The app is minimal but adds a bit more customization. Sadly, there is no touch control customization or EQ. The low latency mode allowed lag or sync to be almost unnoticeable.\\n\\nThe 12mm drivers deliver a sound signature that actually surprised me. The bass has some kick without being too boomy and adds a warm tone to the sound signature. The midrange is present, and the treble is a bit recessed but still bright enough to add some clarity. I must stress that the sound quality heavily depends on the right ear tips.\\n\\nThese buds are as basic as they come. However, one must consider that they are a budget item. If it wasn’t for the fitting issue (it could be different for others), these would be my daily drivers when working out. I still say that they are inexpensive enough to have as a spare or for the kids.',\n",
       " \"I received the Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 for review several weeks ago and have put them through some good testing in different settings - indoors, outdoors, quiet, and loud environments - and I was very surprised at the quality of their sound, connection, and fit for the price. I was able to take advantage of the fast pair option because I have an Android device - it worked well even after un-pairing them. I can attest that they are IPX4 rated because they are still working even after using them when I was sweating buckets during an outdoor activity.\\n\\nThe only reason I can't rate them a 5-star is due to a couple of shortcomings: 1) While they produce decent sound, they aren't the best; and 2) Perhaps the sound might be better if I could download the proprietary app to customize the proper settings (not available in the US). Overall, not a bad option if you're looking for affordable wireless ear buds.\",\n",
       " 'These Redmi Buds 4 Active ear buds from Xiaomi are a very nice budget-friendly option. These are not going to compete at the multi-hundred dollar level of some other brands but at this low a price they are exceptionally capable. The ear buds are very lightweight making them comfortable to wear.\\n\\nThe ear buds have good battery life; Xiaomi seems uncertain how much battery life as they state up to 28 hours in some places and then up to 30 in others. Also, the battery life has a little asterisk next to it in the listing with no definition as to why it is there. What they really should be saying to clarify the battery life is that the ear buds have a battery life around five hours but then the case can charge the ear buds multiple times leading to the total life of 28 (or 30?) hours.\\n\\nThe ear buds are listed as IPX4 with one image going so far as to state \"...hitting the gym and breaking a sweat\" but there is one of those pesky asterisks again. The asterisk is of course not detailed in the product listing but in checking with Xiaomi that asterisk translates to \"Please try to avoid using your earbuds during strenuous exercise, sweat during exercise may cause damage to the device\". Those two quoted statements seem to contradict each other.\\n\\nThere is also basic touch control built into the ear buds which is again nice at the price point. They also feature basic noise cancellation which works reasonably well.\\n\\nEven with all the marketing asterisks, these are a quality set of ear buds when you consider how inexpensive they are.',\n",
       " \"I was surprised to find Xiaomi products available in the US. This is a very well known brand abroad, but almost unknown here.\\nAbout the features and performance: Balanced sound profile, just a bit biased towards bass, light, perfect fit and affordable. It has ENC which helps with voice clarity for people on the other side of a call. Fast pair which is usually only found in way more expensive earbuds. And there is an almost useless phone app.\\nNegative points: The product description is very deceiving, since it advertises 'noise cancellation' without spelling out it is ENC (environment noise cancellation) and not ANC (ambient noise cancellation). One might skim through the text and believe they are ordering earbuds with ANC. I really do not like when manufacturers do that. And I really missed the ability to pair/connect to two devices, which is now table stakes at this price point.\",\n",

They take a little positioning to get a good seal, then they sound good and block sound well. For the cost these are good.\\n\\nEarbuds are build decently. They require some working in each time to get a good seal.\\n\\nSound quality is good. When seated properly bass goes down to 10Hz, but if they aren't fully in bass is poor. Highs sound a little muffled, but nothing major.\\n\\nTouch controls are basic, just play/pause, next track, and call answer/hangup. They do support low-latency (long-touch both sides). No way turn on/off without the case, as is common these days.\\n\\nApp isn't available in the USA. I manually downloaded and installed the app and selected a different region. It doesn't offer any special features, other than firmware updates (none was available).\",\n",
       " 'I use this as a backup pair of buds for when I occasionally misplace my primaries. These do a passable job at voice calls, just a bit tinny. Music, not so much. Will likely replace these with something < $50 but higher quality.',\n",
       " \"At $18, these are... fine. The sound quality is mediocre, there is no noise cancelling, the charge lasts a decent while, they fit ok. On the down side, they feel cheap but that can be good in that they're light weight. The case is small and easy to pocket. Overall, they're exactly what I would expect for the price.\",\n",
       " 'I was surprised that these sound so well. They are of course lacking in bass but music and voice are crystal clear. No issues connecting to my S21+ phone. Battery lasts 8 or more hours pending on the volume setting. I can recommend these for a low cost set.',\n",
       " 'At this price they are pretty much disposable and I’m fine letting my kids use these at the risk of being lost. However the sound quality is decent enough that I’d use them for casual use cases. They’re ok to wear, not uncomfortable but not something I’d probably want all day either.\\n\\nThe buttons work to play and pause but when trying to force into pairing mode to connect with a new device I can’t get them to do it. The instructions say to touch both ear buds 3 times at the same time but it doesn’t seem to work. To pair to a new device I had to walk out into the yard to get away from the other device, turn them on, and pair with the new one. It’s annoying but I don’t need to change them that frequently.',\n",
       " 'Using these with a Pixel 7, the one touch connect was straight forward. Go to your bluetooth settings and after you open the buds they try to connect with your phone (it\\'s usually the other way around where you have to choose the device), just press connect and go (albeit connecting any bluetooth headphones is easy also). The nice part is shows the battery status when you look at your bluetooth devices. My other headphones would just die without notice, so it\\'s nice knowing when I need to charge. The sound quality at this price point is really amazing! Boomy bass and crisp highs, the caveat being you have to choose the correct tips. I tried them first with the tips that came on default and I thought the sound was very lacking. I have another set of similar style buds that I really like, so I was comparing these Xiaomi\\'s to those to figure out if the Xiaomi\\'s were any good. I didn\\'t think it was close at first, with my older one\\'s being way better, but then just for kicks I swapped bud tips and it made a big difference! My older ones no longer sounded good, and the Xiaomi\\'s sounded great! There is not a big selection of tips included (2 other sizes), but luckily one of the included sizes worked or I would\\'ve have to kept the bud tips swapped with my older set. These are my new favorite cheap wireless headphones! I don\\'t know about 30 hrs of battery life, but I got a solid 8 hrs of constant play from 100% and ended on 20% battery left. The noise cancelling on a phone call is decent, but it all hinges on having the right size bud tips on. The touch controls work but I have never gotten a pair wireless buds with touch to work properly, these are no exception. You have to know the correct number of \"taps\" to do a function. Not worth being a selling point. Overall, these are easy recommend for what they are, a good pair of low cost wireless headphones!',\n",
       " \"I was wanting to be wowed by the Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 Active. The price is fantastic, and I thought they might be a worthy budget alternative to Airpods and other high end wireless earbuds. While the connectivity is great and the feature set is impressive with the Redmi Buds 4, they are sonically underwhelming. So while they are a nice pair of earbuds at a great price, you won't mistake them for Airpods or Bose Quiet Comfort earbuds or Beats or any other premium earbud.\\nThe first thing you'll notice when unboxing these is the case. It is a sleek little black rounded square. A bit light and a little slick but sharp looking design-wise. The charging port is at the bottom with an unobtrusive LED next to it.\\nConnectivity is great. The Redmi Buds easily paired to my Android phone and connect right away every time, even with the phone locked or charging. Xiaomi has an app for these, but if you try to get it through the Play Store, it isn't available in the US. I imagine the same is true for iOS. I downloaded and installed the APK and had to tell the app I was from Canada. But I found that the Xiaomi Earbuds app was mostly unnecessary. There's not much the app can do that is not available in the basic Android settings. Xiaomi says you need the app for firmware updates, and you can turn on low-latency mode for gaming through the app. Battery status and find device are available through Android settings without using the app.\\nNow let's get down to brass tacks and talk about sound. I'm a bit of an audiophile and like my music loud and clear. I found the Redmi Buds to be underwhelming in the audio department. Vocal clarity is great, and they work well for voice calls. They are also great for anything with speech - videos, movies, TV or what have you. For music, I found the bass response to be poor overall. The volume is also too low for me. I like to crank my audio gear to 11 (at least some of the time), and these don't crank. Turned all the way up, the Redmi Buds won't blow you away. You won't feel like you're at the concert. I would imagine that the volume limit is intentionally built into the firmware for safety reasons or to prevent distortion.\\nNoise cancellation works well on these earbuds. It does compensate somewhat for the lack of high volume. A couple different sizes of ear tips are included in the box. For the most part, the Redmi Buds do a great job of blocking out environmental noise.\\nBattery life is very good, especially for earbuds at this price point. Xiaomi claims 5 hours for the earbuds and 28 hours for the case. I've just been wearing them around the house so far and haven't come close to running them out.\\nAs for other features, the Redmi Buds have touch controls which I haven't totally figured out yet. Two taps on either earbud will pause and play. Triple tap does something and long pressing does something else. There's a huge manual in the box that seems to mostly safety warnings in multiple languages with a lot of pictures to describe what to do. I'll figure them out eventually, but suffice to say that they do have touch control. I am not using these for gaming, so I haven't tried low latency mode. The box includes the earbuds, charging case, 2 sets of different sized tips, a USB-C charging cable, and a (huge) instruction manual.\\nThe good:\\n- Connectivity is great. Easy pairing and Bluetooth connection.\\n- Vocal clarity is very good.\\n- Noise cancellation is good.\\n- Great battery life. Easy and quick charging.\\n- IPX4 waterproof. Good for sweat/working out.\\n- The price is awesome. Xiaomi has included a lot of premium features at a budget price point.\\n\\nThe bad:\\n- Official app is not available in US and is mostly worthless anyway.\\n- Low volume and underwhelming bass response. They don't crank.\\n\\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with these. They are great for everyday use and travel, but if I want truly immersive audiophile sound, I'll have to spring for the extra $$$ and get a premium brand\",\n",
       " 'Good sound quality love it',\n",

From the moment I unboxed them, I was impressed by the sleek design and the quality of the materials used.\\n\\nSound Quality: The sound quality is outstanding. The bass is deep and rich, the mids are clear, and the highs are crisp without being harsh. Whether I’m listening to music, podcasts, or taking calls, the audio experience is consistently excellent.\\n\\nComfort: These earbuds are incredibly comfortable to wear, even for extended periods. They come with multiple sizes of ear tips, ensuring a perfect fit for any ear.

They offer a perfect blend of sound quality, comfort, and convenience. I highly recommend them to anyone in the market for a new pair of earbuds.',\n",
       " 'I purchased these Btootos wireless earbuds in July. For the price, I wasn’t expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. These truly are a quality product.\\nThey connected easily and the sound is impressive and so clear. I listen to a lot of music while exercising and walking and I appreciate the quality.\\nThese buds are some of the most comfortable I’ve owned. No break in period needed! You can find a tip that’s perfect for your ear. The battery life has be more than sufficient- I use them for many hours without having to recharge.\\nI’ve been very pleased with my purchase and if you’re debating which ones to get, buy these!! You won’t be disappointed.',\n",
       " 'I have been through at least 6 earbuds already, trying to get one that basically does everything I need! I work at home and was looking for earbuds that check off all the boxes I need! So here is my take on these... SO far. I will write a follow up IF need be:\\n\\n1. VOICE AND MUSIC: First and foremost, I need buds that actually work WELL with voice. So far, I can hear my customers well (and I have hearing loss), and amazingly they can actually hear me well! As far as music, they sound fine to me. No, they are not top of the line but for the average person they are absolutely fine. Even nice. One thing though, I have an equalizer on my phone for a nice deeper bass sound. I had to turn that off. At first I thought these buds were awful or broken, but as soon as I shut off the equalizer the sound came in very clear. Best bass?... no, but certainly good enough.\\n\\n2. DISTANCE away from the PC. All my others either lost connection or started breaking up as soon as I stepped away from the PC. With these, I can walk around most of my apartment (albeit a fairly small apartment). If I go into the garage or the far bedroom I will lose connection but I can live with that. Rarely go in there during the day while working.\\n\\n3. CONNECTIVITY.... so far they have not disconnected while talking at my desk. No breaking up either.\\n\\n4. PAIRING... AMAZING. They came fully charged, and paired with my PC in a flash. But what I really LOVE about these is IF I do step too far and get a \"disconnected\" prompt, BUT the second I get within a close enough distance they reconnect on their own! For all the others I have had so far, I have had to get back to my desk and re-pair the buds! This is awesome for me.\\n\\n5. FIT: Wonderful for me, with very small ear canals! Never had that before. All others fell out way too often, even causing me to lose one on a walk. I did have to change to the smallest accessory silicone pieces for the ear canal, but they have fit fantastically and have not fallen out on their own once so far!\\n\\nCONS: The only negative comment I have at all is definitely NOT a deal breaker. They are slippery (not in a liquid sense) getting in and out of the case. They want to run away. LOL\\n\\nSUMMARY: If you are looking for nice earbuds that do the job pretty darn close to the very expensive ones, try these! I believe you will be happy you did not put out the big bucks. For the record, I have returned $200+ earbuds because they did work as I expected, but these do! Great Product... NOW we will see how they last.',\n",
       " 'I love music and I like to listen to music while jogging. If I do not have music, I don\\'t want to exercise at all. Music gives me energy and pleasure as I exercise. Therefore I need a pair of Bluetooth earbuds that has excellent sound quality to help me exercise with pleasure.\\n\\nI bought the A90 Pro True Wireless Earbuds to replace the ones that cost less because of unsteady connection at specific locations while jogging with an MP4 player in a pocket of my shorts. I found that connection of the A90 Pro earbuds was much more steady than the ones that cost $6 less. There was only a split second of unsteady connection with the A90 Pro earbuds when passing the entrance of a company with lots security equipment instead of a few seconds of unsteady connection experienced with the ones that cost less.\\n\\nI later found out that I was supposed to keep my MP4 player at chest level with an armband case or hold the MP4 player at chest level with my hand while jogging instead of putting it in a pocket of my shorts where it was subjected to vigorous shaking. When the MP4 player was kept at chest level, there was no problem of unsteady connection anymore.\\n\\nIt should also be noted that the strength of connection between a music player with Bluetooth does not solely depend on the quality of the Bluetooth receivers of the earbuds but depends on the quality of the Bluetooth transmitter of the music player as well. So it is important to have a music player with a good Bluetooth transmitter to work with these earbuds with good Bluetooth receivers.\\n\\nThe A90 Pro earbuds are very secure in my ears no matter how fast I jog or run. I never worry about them falling off. They are so comfortable to wear that I barely feel anything in my ears but the beautiful music.\\n\\nListening to music at home within a large room is no problem at all. I can leave my MP4 player on my desk and I can listen to music anywhere in my room with very steady connection. If I go outside my room and the connection is broken up, the earbuds will automatically reconnect with my MP4 player when I walk back in my room within 5 minutes. So far I have only used the earbuds non-stop for 3 hours with no problem. I have not tested exactly how long the the earbuds can be used non-stop. I expect them to play much longer than 3 hours.\\n\\nI am very satisfied with the sound quality of the A90 Pro earbuds. But in the first few days I was not quite satisfied in spite of the high definition sound that allowed me to hear every instrument and the vocal distinctively because I could hear only normal bass but not the heavy bass that I loved. I was so happy when I found out that when I switched the earbud tips from small to large, my ears were bombarded joyfully with heavy bass that I loved.\\n\\nIt turned out if you use earbud tips that are too small, the bass can not be enhanced. However, if you use earbud tips that are big enough to seal off your ear canals, you get heavy bass. Therefore, if you love heavy bass, put on the largest earbud tips that you are comfortable with to find out if you can hear the same dramatic and wonderful transformation to heavy bass that I am enjoying now. You can search YouTube for some extreme bass music videos to test how good the bass from the earbuds has become. With the music and heavy bass that I love playing from the A90 Pro earbuds, my jogging is now more like dancing than jogging and I love it.\\n\\nEven though I can tell that the sound quality of the A90 Pro earbuds is very good when I listen to music with strong beat for exercise outdoors in spite of traffic noise around, it was not until I used the earbuds to listen to some exquisite instrumental music at home in the quiet of the night that I realized how magnificent the sound quality of the A90 Pro earbuds is. In fact when the A90 Pro earbuds are used in combination with the large earbud tips to enhance the bass, they sound just as good as ( Correction: I found out later that as far as super bass is concerned, not just as good as but MUCH better than) the very expensive professional headphones that I have in spite of their much smaller size. The A90 Pro earbuds are indeed earbuds of professional quality.\\n\\nMoreover, the A90 Pro earbuds also have the advantage of allowing me to blast the music at full volume at night without worrying about anyone complain about being disturbed by the music if I use the headphones instead. Remember the ugly headphone hair that comes with using the headphones? That problem is also solved by using the A90 Pro earbuds.\\n\\nI suggest every new owner of the A90 Pro earbuds spend some time practicing how to control various functions of the A90 Pro earbuds so that one can enjoy using the earbuds with ease of control and would not mistake wrong control on the earbuds as malfunction.\\n\\nI would recommend the A90 Pro True Wireless Earbuds to anybody who wants to have a pair of high quality Bluetooth earbuds at a reasonable price.\\n\\nAdditional Review about Heavy Bass: My review is probably too long already. However, since I found some music videos on YouTube with heavy or super bass that have demonstrated beyond doubt the superiority of the A90 Pro earbuds over the expensive professional headphones that I have during comparison, I just can\\'t help but inform people shopping for earbuds or headphones about it. (Don\\'t forget to use the largest earbud tips your ears can handle.)\\nHere are the titles of two music videos that I want to share (No links allowed on Amazon reviews) :\\nDj Kantik - Teriyaki Boyz - Tokyo Drift & Sean Paul - Temperature (Remix)\\nFor this song, both the A90 Pro earbuds and my expensive headphones sounded equally well at high volume. However, I could only use the headphones to play at high volume at night very briefly for comparison because the leaking sound was too loud.\\n\\nIn The Air Tonight - Phil Collins (Extreme Bass Boost)\\nSeriously, when I first heard the extreme bass of this track with the A90 Pro earbuds, I really thought there was an earthquake. I also had the illusion that my monitor was vibrating while my brain was being bombarded by the super bass. I was flabbergasted that the tiny A90 Pro earbuds could create such mind-boggling super bass at high volume without being impaired at all.\\nOn the other hand, I was surprised that my expensive headphones could not handle the super bass of the same track and the super bass sounded like the speakers got damaged.\\n\\nOf course, the A90 Pro earbuds should not be compared to the performance of a $10,000 high-end home audio system. But for such a wonderful price, the performance of the A90 Pro earbuds have far exceeded my highest expectation of what earbuds should sound like.\\n\\nAdditional Review about Using Two Devices: I have been using the same A90 Pro earbuds with two different devices, my MP4 player and my computer with a Bluetooth Transceiver which I bought later. When I want to use the earbuds with the computer, I have to go to the Bluetooth page of my MP4 player and turn off the Bluetooth connection on that device first before I can connect the earbuds automatically with the transceiver. After that if I want to use the earbuds with the MP4 player again, turning the power of the transceiver to OFF is only the first step. I have to turn the Bluetooth function of the MP4 player to the ON position again to make the earbuds work.\\nWe should understand that there is no such thing as \"automatic connection of the A90 Pro earbuds with two devices\" because whether you can use the earbuds with a device can depend on if the Bluetooth function of the device has been turned ON or OFF. Just because I turned off the transceiver doesn\\'t mean the Bluetooth function in my MP4 player will turn back on automatically. Therefore, I have to turn the Bluetooth function in the MP4 player back to the ON position again before I can use the MP4 player after using the earbuds with my transceiver . There were times when I forgot to turn the Bluetooth of the MP4 player back on and thought mistakenly that the earbuds were to blame when there was nothing wrong with the earbuds at all.\\nI also saw a one star review complaining that the description lies about the earbuds would automatically switch between devices so we would not have to manually disconnect them in order to pair them with another device. Obviously, that complaint was due to the customer\\'s misunderstanding of the description on page 4 about \"How do I pair two headphones with my phone?\". ( \" two headphones\" should be described as \"the two earbuds\" instead.) Nowhere does the the User Guide claim the earbuds would automatically switch between devices so you would not have to manually disconnect them in order to pair them with another device. In fact that is not possible with any brand of Bluetooth earbuds because a portable device that a user doesn\\'t want to use anymore cannot read the mind of the user and turn off the Bluetooth function automatically. If the Bluetooth function of a device has been turned off, it cannot read the mind of the user to turn the Bluetooth back on automatically, either. However, in the situation that the earbuds are used on a second device that is so far away from the first device that the earbuds are disconnected due to the loss of signal, then the Bluetooth function of the first device needs not be turned off before pairing the earbuds with the second device.\\n\\nOn the other hand, headphones that use radio signal without Bluetooth can be plugged into either a computer or a TV set and used without pairing at all but they have to work with a bulky transmitter which is not suitable for portable devices.\\n\\nI love these earbuds so much that I bought another pair as spare.',\n",

They are absolutely excellent at noise canceling. I have severe issues with hearing EVERY, SINGLE, LITTLE sound all of the time in my house and I need some peace and quiet sometimes, I will literally just put them in for the silence, no kids, no fiancé, no dogs, no neighbors, nothing, it seriously helps my anxiety.

You get a notification with battery status for each bud (this battery status also shows up when paired to other devices). Touch controls are basic: track control, and pause. I\\'m only on bluetooth 5.1 here so I don\\'t think I\\'m getting the low latency feature here even when I enable it.\\n\\nAndroid offered to set up \\'Find My Device\\'. There is also the ability to ring the earbud if you lose it without enabling that. Sound is not very loud, but still would be helpful locating a misplaced bud.\\n\\nThere is a QR code to download a Xiaomi app. It takes me to their site which redirects to a US subdomain, and then to the play store app, but the play store says \"This item isn\\'t available in your country\". So much for firmware updates or toggling features from the phone I guess.\\n\\n== Physical ==\\n\\nThese have oblong silicone earbud tips. The medium looked closer to normal small size, but I still had to switch to the small for a good fit (I normally use the small size). Fit is comfortable. They are light and pretty unobtrusive. I found the light weight with the oblong tip does a good job keeping the earbud in place even though they lack positive retention.\\n\\nThe charging case with buds weighs about 41.5g. The pair of buds is only 7.6g.\\n\\n== Usage ==\\n\\nInstructions are a bit too Ikea, and then the text explanations that do exist are on different pages than the picture instructions so it is difficult to decipher them.\\n\\nLow latency mode has to be manually enabled by holding both bud\\'s touch buttons for 1.5 seconds. A 3-tone chime plays. You can\\'t turn it back off without putting them back in the case.\\n\\nThe buds seems to handle switching devices OK. I can disconnect on my phone, turn my transmitter on, and they pair to it. To get them back on the phone I have to manually connect again though. I didn\\'t find any automatic method so I don\\'t have to interact with the currently paired device though.\\n\\nThey are not the best at blocking external sounds out, but this is probably desirable in an active bud where you want to hear your surroundings.',\n",
       " 'The overall design is simple. The matte black case fends off smudges well and so do the stem buds. In the hands, both the case and the buds feel very light and somewhat cheap. But that’s not such a bad thing as the weight allows the buds to not be felt in the ear after a little while. When listening on the couch or relaxing, they are great. However, in my experience, the oval shape of the buds makes them slippery with a bit of sweat when doing light housework or walking, and I had to constantly adjust them, which is very distracting. I worry they might fall off when running or doing dynamic exercise. By the way, training or heavy sweat is not a problem due to the IPX4 rating.\\n\\nThe buds paired easily with my Android phone using the fast pair feature. Bluetooth 5.3 allowed the buds to stay connected at decent distances without hiccups. The touch controls worked well for the most part, but I am disappointed that there seems to be no volume option. The 5-hour battery life is pretty good for a day’s on-off regular use, but for those extended listening sessions, the quick charge feature adds over 1.5 hours in just 10 minutes of charging. The case adds up to 28 hours. There is no wireless charging option and there is no USB-C cord included.\\n\\nAlthough there is no active noise cancellation, by choosing the proper included tips, a good amount of noise is blocked and not a problem when playing. The call quality is more than decent, as I heard clearly, and even the wind was barely an issue. The app is minimal but adds a bit more customization. Sadly, there is no touch control customization or EQ. The low latency mode allowed lag or sync to be almost unnoticeable.\\n\\nThe 12mm drivers deliver a sound signature that actually surprised me. The bass has some kick without being too boomy and adds a warm tone to the sound signature. The midrange is present, and the treble is a bit recessed but still bright enough to add some clarity. I must stress that the sound quality heavily depends on the right ear tips.\\n\\nThese buds are as basic as they come. However, one must consider that they are a budget item. If it wasn’t for the fitting issue (it could be different for others), these would be my daily drivers when working out. I still say that they are inexpensive enough to have as a spare or for the kids.',\n",
       " \"I received the Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 for review several weeks ago and have put them through some good testing in different settings - indoors, outdoors, quiet, and loud environments - and I was very surprised at the quality of their sound, connection, and fit for the price. I was able to take advantage of the fast pair option because I have an Android device - it worked well even after un-pairing them. I can attest that they are IPX4 rated because they are still working even after using them when I was sweating buckets during an outdoor activity.\\n\\nThe only reason I can't rate them a 5-star is due to a couple of shortcomings: 1) While they produce decent sound, they aren't the best; and 2) Perhaps the sound might be better if I could download the proprietary app to customize the proper settings (not available in the US). Overall, not a bad option if you're looking for affordable wireless ear buds.\",\n",
       " 'These Redmi Buds 4 Active ear buds from Xiaomi are a very nice budget-friendly option. These are not going to compete at the multi-hundred dollar level of some other brands but at this low a price they are exceptionally capable. The ear buds are very lightweight making them comfortable to wear.\\n\\nThe ear buds have good battery life; Xiaomi seems uncertain how much battery life as they state up to 28 hours in some places and then up to 30 in others. Also, the battery life has a little asterisk next to it in the listing with no definition as to why it is there. What they really should be saying to clarify the battery life is that the ear buds have a battery life around five hours but then the case can charge the ear buds multiple times leading to the total life of 28 (or 30?) hours.\\n\\nThe ear buds are listed as IPX4 with one image going so far as to state \"...hitting the gym and breaking a sweat\" but there is one of those pesky asterisks again. The asterisk is of course not detailed in the product listing but in checking with Xiaomi that asterisk translates to \"Please try to avoid using your earbuds during strenuous exercise, sweat during exercise may cause damage to the device\". Those two quoted statements seem to contradict each other.\\n\\nThere is also basic touch control built into the ear buds which is again nice at the price point. They also feature basic noise cancellation which works reasonably well.\\n\\nEven with all the marketing asterisks, these are a quality set of ear buds when you consider how inexpensive they are.',\n",
       " \"I was surprised to find Xiaomi products available in the US. This is a very well known brand abroad, but almost unknown here.\\nAbout the features and performance: Balanced sound profile, just a bit biased towards bass, light, perfect fit and affordable. It has ENC which helps with voice clarity for people on the other side of a call. Fast pair which is usually only found in way more expensive earbuds. And there is an almost useless phone app.\\nNegative points: The product description is very deceiving, since it advertises 'noise cancellation' without spelling out it is ENC (environment noise cancellation) and not ANC (ambient noise cancellation). One might skim through the text and believe they are ordering earbuds with ANC. I really do not like when manufacturers do that. And I really missed the ability to pair/connect to two devices, which is now table stakes at this price point.\",\n",
       " \"I got these for everyday listening, specifically for their sound-blocking due to using silicone inserts. They take a little positioning to get a good seal, then they sound good and block sound well. For the cost these are good.\\n\\nEarbuds are build decently. They require some working in each time to get a good seal.\\n\\nSound quality is good. When seated properly bass goes down to 10Hz, but if they aren't fully in bass is poor. Highs sound a little muffled, but nothing major.\\n\\nTouch controls are basic, just play/pause, next track, and call answer/hangup. They do support low-latency (long-touch both sides). No way turn on/off without the case, as is common these days.\\n\\nApp isn't available in the USA. I manually downloaded and installed the app and selected a different region. It doesn't offer any special features, other than firmware updates (none was available).\",\n",
       " 'I use this as a backup pair of buds for when I occasionally misplace my primaries. These do a passable job at voice calls, just a bit tinny. Music, not so much. Will likely replace these with something < $50 but higher quality.',\n",
       " \"At $18, these are... fine. The sound quality is mediocre, there is no noise cancelling, the charge lasts a decent while, they fit ok. On the down side, they feel cheap but that can be good in that they're light weight. The case is small and easy to pocket. Overall, they're exactly what I would expect for the price.\",\n",
       " 'I was surprised that these sound so well. They are of course lacking in bass but music and voice are crystal clear. No issues connecting to my S21+ phone. Battery lasts 8 or more hours pending on the volume setting. I can recommend these for a low cost set.',\n",
       " 'At this price they are pretty much disposable and I’m fine letting my kids use these at the risk of being lost. However the sound quality is decent enough that I’d use them for casual use cases. They’re ok to wear, not uncomfortable but not something I’d probably want all day either.\\n\\nThe buttons work to play and pause but when trying to force into pairing mode to connect with a new device I can’t get them to do it. The instructions say to touch both ear buds 3 times at the same time but it doesn’t seem to work. To pair to a new device I had to walk out into the yard to get away from the other device, turn them on, and pair with the new one. It’s annoying but I don’t need to change them that frequently.',\n",
       " 'Using these with a Pixel 7, the one touch connect was straight forward. Go to your bluetooth settings and after you open the buds they try to connect with your phone (it\\'s usually the other way around where you have to choose the device), just press connect and go (albeit connecting any bluetooth headphones is easy also). The nice part is shows the battery status when you look at your bluetooth devices. My other headphones would just die without notice, so it\\'s nice knowing when I need to charge. The sound quality at this price point is really amazing! Boomy bass and crisp highs, the caveat being you have to choose the correct tips. I tried them first with the tips that came on default and I thought the sound was very lacking. I have another set of similar style buds that I really like, so I was comparing these Xiaomi\\'s to those to figure out if the Xiaomi\\'s were any good. I didn\\'t think it was close at first, with my older one\\'s being way better, but then just for kicks I swapped bud tips and it made a big difference! My older ones no longer sounded good, and the Xiaomi\\'s sounded great! There is not a big selection of tips included (2 other sizes), but luckily one of the included sizes worked or I would\\'ve have to kept the bud tips swapped with my older set. These are my new favorite cheap wireless headphones! I don\\'t know about 30 hrs of battery life, but I got a solid 8 hrs of constant play from 100% and ended on 20% battery left. The noise cancelling on a phone call is decent, but it all hinges on having the right size bud tips on. The touch controls work but I have never gotten a pair wireless buds with touch to work properly, these are no exception. You have to know the correct number of \"taps\" to do a function. Not worth being a selling point. Overall, these are easy recommend for what they are, a good pair of low cost wireless headphones!',\n",
       " \"I was wanting to be wowed by the Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 Active. The price is fantastic, and I thought they might be a worthy budget alternative to Airpods and other high end wireless earbuds. While the connectivity is great and the feature set is impressive with the Redmi Buds 4, they are sonically underwhelming. So while they are a nice pair of earbuds at a great price, you won't mistake them for Airpods or Bose Quiet Comfort earbuds or Beats or any other premium earbud.\\nThe first thing you'll notice when unboxing these is the case. It is a sleek little black rounded square. A bit light and a little slick but sharp looking design-wise. The charging port is at the bottom with an unobtrusive LED next to it.\\nConnectivity is great. The Redmi Buds easily paired to my Android phone and connect right away every time, even with the phone locked or charging. Xiaomi has an app for these, but if you try to get it through the Play Store, it isn't available in the US. I imagine the same is true for iOS. I downloaded and installed the APK and had to tell the app I was from Canada. But I found that the Xiaomi Earbuds app was mostly unnecessary. There's not much the app can do that is not available in the basic Android settings. Xiaomi says you need the app for firmware updates, and you can turn on low-latency mode for gaming through the app. Battery status and find device are available through Android settings without using the app.\\nNow let's get down to brass tacks and talk about sound. I'm a bit of an audiophile and like my music loud and clear. I found the Redmi Buds to be underwhelming in the audio department. Vocal clarity is great, and they work well for voice calls. They are also great for anything with speech - videos, movies, TV or what have you. For music, I found the bass response to be poor overall. The volume is also too low for me. I like to crank my audio gear to 11 (at least some of the time), and these don't crank. Turned all the way up, the Redmi Buds won't blow you away. You won't feel like you're at the concert. I would imagine that the volume limit is intentionally built into the firmware for safety reasons or to prevent distortion.\\nNoise cancellation works well on these earbuds. It does compensate somewhat for the lack of high volume. A couple different sizes of ear tips are included in the box. For the most part, the Redmi Buds do a great job of blocking out environmental noise.\\nBattery life is very good, especially for earbuds at this price point. Xiaomi claims 5 hours for the earbuds and 28 hours for the case. I've just been wearing them around the house so far and haven't come close to running them out.\\nAs for other features, the Redmi Buds have touch controls which I haven't totally figured out yet. Two taps on either earbud will pause and play. Triple tap does something and long pressing does something else. There's a huge manual in the box that seems to mostly safety warnings in multiple languages with a lot of pictures to describe what to do. I'll figure them out eventually, but suffice to say that they do have touch control. I am not using these for gaming, so I haven't tried low latency mode. The box includes the earbuds, charging case, 2 sets of different sized tips, a USB-C charging cable, and a (huge) instruction manual.\\nThe good:\\n- Connectivity is great. Easy pairing and Bluetooth connection.\\n- Vocal clarity is very good.\\n- Noise cancellation is good.\\n- Great battery life. Easy and quick charging.\\n- IPX4 waterproof. Good for sweat/working out.\\n- The price is awesome. Xiaomi has included a lot of premium features at a budget price point.\\n\\nThe bad:\\n- Official app is not available in US and is mostly worthless anyway.\\n- Low volume and underwhelming bass response. They don't crank.\\n\\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with these. They are great for everyday use and travel, but if I want truly immersive audiophile sound, I'll have to spring for the extra $$$ and get a premium brand\",\n",
