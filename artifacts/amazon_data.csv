Pros:- Pairs and switches well with multiple devices (my Android and my PC)- Decent sound- Decently comfortable (and I'm REALLY picky)Cons:- Battery life of the earbuds is just ok- No ANC (which would be a miracle at this price)
"

Sound quality is okay for this price. They are very light, comfortable and small. Minus one star because they do not control volume level and app is not available when I scan barcode.

Honestamente, el sonido que emite el audífono es nítido, el confort del audífono en el oído muy suave en mi primera impresión y en efecto la calidad parecen de mentira, no pesan nada, son muy ligeros y el emparejamiento a mi teléfono Samsung S20 FE podría calificarlo como DEMASIADO bueno, solo abrí la tapita del case y se emparejaron SUPER rápido como que si mi teléfono fuese Redmi, insano.

Easy to operate, good product quality, very satisfied.

I was hoping for it to blow my head off but its still attached. Its pretty quiet but even when on the road its still enjoyable. It lets you hear what is going on outside. So it has no noice cancellation and its as if noise transparency is on at all times. I was hoping for an app to tune these buds like other headphones but it doesnt. But still good just a bit too quiet. Btw it works alot for calls and im super quiet when on the phone i pretty much whisper and people still hear me no matter what.

Despite not being Apple airpods, these earbuds do the trick. They are very responsive and have strong battery life. I can tap the earbud and it instantly works and responds to my phone apps.If you want to save some money on Apple airpods, this product is a cheap, efficient, alternative.Something to note; the case is wireless charging and uses USB-C connection to charge the case.Overall, a steal in price comparied to how expensive other earbuds are listed on the internet.

Overall had these for about a month. So far so good. Sound quality is good but not too much bass. For the price I think these are great. Been using them for my outdoor walks and have only charged them once so far. They seem to fit well even while moving around. Highly recommend for the price.

Me encantaron, aunque tenen varios puntos negativos, el volumen es algo bajo, la calidad es decente para su precio (osea no es la mejor precisamente), los botones tactiles casi no me funcionan nose porqué, sin embargo la bateria les dura mucho, pero de verdad me dejan asombrado, tengo unos semi in hear que uso para el dia a dia que son superiores a estos en todo lo anterior menos en la duracion de bateria y cuestan el doble, estos los compré para el gym, estan geniales para lo poco que cuestan.

I recently purchased a pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds, and I couldn’t be happier with my decision. From the moment I unboxed them, I was impressed by the sleek design and the quality of the materials used.Sound Quality: The sound quality is outstanding. The bass is deep and rich, the mids are clear, and the highs are crisp without being harsh. Whether I’m listening to music, podcasts, or taking calls, the audio experience is consistently excellent.Comfort: These earbuds are incredibly comfortable to wear, even for extended periods. They come with multiple sizes of ear tips, ensuring a perfect fit for any ear. I can wear them during workouts, commutes, or just lounging at home without any discomfort.Battery Life: The battery life is impressive. I can use them for hours on end without needing to recharge. The charging case is compact and convenient, providing additional charges on the go.Connectivity: Pairing the earbuds with my devices was a breeze. The Bluetooth connection is stable and has a good range, allowing me to move around freely without losing connection.Additional Features: I love the touch controls on the earbuds, which make it easy to play/pause music, skip tracks, and answer calls without reaching for my phone. The built-in microphone also delivers clear voice quality during calls.Overall, these wireless Bluetooth earbuds have exceeded my expectations in every way. They offer a perfect blend of sound quality, comfort, and convenience. I highly recommend them to anyone in the market for a new pair of earbuds.

I purchased these Btootos wireless earbuds in July. For the price, I wasn’t expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. These truly are a quality product.They connected easily and the sound is impressive and so clear. I listen to a lot of music while exercising and walking and I appreciate the quality.These buds are some of the most comfortable I’ve owned. No break in period needed! You can find a tip that’s perfect for your ear. The battery life has be more than sufficient- I use them for many hours without having to recharge.I’ve been very pleased with my purchase and if you’re debating which ones to get, buy these!! You won’t be disappointed.

I have been through at least 6 earbuds already, trying to get one that basically does everything I need!  I work at home and was looking for earbuds that check off all the boxes I need!  So here is my take on these... SO far.  I will write a follow up IF need be:1.  VOICE AND MUSIC:  First and foremost, I need buds that actually work WELL with voice.  So far, I can hear my customers well (and I have hearing loss), and amazingly they can actually hear me well! As far as music, they sound fine to me.  No, they are not top of the line but for the average person they are absolutely fine.  Even nice.  One thing though, I have an equalizer on my phone for a nice deeper bass sound.  I had to turn that off.  At first I thought these buds were awful or broken, but as soon as I shut off the equalizer the sound came in very clear.  Best bass?...  no, but certainly good enough.2.  DISTANCE away from the PC.  All my others either lost connection or started breaking up as soon as I stepped away from the PC.  With these, I can walk around most of my apartment (albeit a fairly small apartment).  If I go into the garage or the far bedroom  I will lose connection but I can live with that.  Rarely go in there during the day while working.3.  CONNECTIVITY.... so far they have not disconnected while talking at my desk.  No breaking up either.4.  PAIRING... AMAZING.  They came fully charged, and paired with my PC in a flash.  But what I really LOVE about these is IF I do step too far and get a ""disconnected"" prompt, BUT the second I get within a close enough distance they reconnect on their own!  For all the others I have had so far, I have had to get back to my desk and re-pair the buds!  This is awesome for me.5.  FIT:  Wonderful for me, with very small ear canals!  Never had that before. All others fell out way too often, even causing me to lose one on a walk.  I did have to change to the smallest accessory silicone pieces for the ear canal, but they have fit fantastically and have not fallen out on their own once so far!CONS:  The only negative comment I have at all is definitely NOT a deal breaker.  They are slippery (not in a liquid sense) getting in and out of the case.  They want to run away.  LOLSUMMARY:  If you are looking for nice earbuds that do the job pretty darn close to the very expensive ones, try these!  I believe you will be happy you did not put out the big bucks.  For the record, I have returned $200+ earbuds because they did work as I expected, but these do!  Great Product... NOW we will see how they last.

Le réel plus de ces écouteurs est sa durée d'autonomie vraiment très importante. Le boitier de rangement est compact et pratique pour voir le niveau de charge de chaque écouteurs. Le son est vraiment agréable. Niveau qualité/prix, je n’ai pas trouvé mieux,  je conseille vivement !!!

Audio perfetto, la batteria dura a lungo, una volta accoppiate al dispositivo con cui si vogliono utilizzare si riconnettono automaticamente ogni volta che vengono estratte dalla custodia caricatore.Molto sensibili i comandi touch, quindi bisogna prenderci la mano.Acquisto consigliato.
"

Je les utilise pour écouter des films, YouTube et mes cours d’anglais. Je les rechargent toutes les trois semaines environs le son est très bien. Moi je les ai acheté il y a un mois en noirs et ceux là sont pour ma femme en bleus qui en est satisfaite.

Ich habe zeitgleich mit diesen Kopfhörern ein Paar Apple AirPods geliehen bekommen, so dass ich den direkten Vergleich hatte. Mein persönlicher Eindruck ist, dass an den Sound der AirPods nichts heran kommt - kristallklar und die Bässe wunderbar akzentuiert, nicht zu viel und nicht zu wenig. Im direkten Vergleich schwächeln die Bässe der Btooto Kopfhörer ein wenig, deshalb einen halben Stern Abzug, aber dennoch ist der Sound wirklich gut! Ohne den Vergleich wird man wahrscheinlich gar nichts zu beanstanden haben.Ich habe beide Paare auf einer längeren Fahrradfahrt getestet, da ich mehrfach in der Woche eine Strecke von ca. 40 Kilometern fahre und das langsam langweilig wird. Da es nichts Neues zu sehen gibt, wollte ich Entertainment wenigstens auf den Ohren. Bei der noch vorherrschenden Kälte bin ich mit Sturmhaube unterm Helm gefahren und beide Paare funktionierten problemlos, allerdings reagieren die Btootos auf Antippen nur, wenn die Finger die Sensoren berühren - durch Stoff, mit Handschuhen oder durch lange Haare geht es nicht. Dafür einen weiteren halben Stern Abzug, da die AirPods das hinbekommen.ABER, die Btootos haben wesentlich mehr Funktionen - Pause/Wiedergabe, Titel vor und zurück sowie leise oder lauter stellen ist hier alles an den Kopfhörern regulierbar. Die AirPods haben auf jeder Seite nur eine Funktion und zum Lautstärke regulieren muss man auf jeden Fall das Ursprungsgerät bedienen. Beim Radfahren super unpraktisch, da ich sowohl über Feld, durch Wald und an Straßen vorbei fahre, wo unterschiedliche Umgebungslautstärken herrschen. Da jedes Mal anhalten, absteigen und das Handy rauskramen zu müssen, geht gar nicht. Deshalb wieder einen halben Stern dazu. :-)Bisher haben sie sich immer problemlos automatisch mit dem Handy verbunden, Anrufe funktionieren, laden ist prima mit der Anzeige des Akkustands und sie sitzen fester in den Ohren als die AirPods aufgrund der Gummistöpsel. Habe da wohl die kleinste Größe wählen müssen, damit sie passen - für Leute mit sehr kleinen Ohren könnte es eng werden. Die Auswahl an Farben ist auch schön - ich hab das Altrosa und finde es chic.Fazit ist, dass ich mit diesen Gerät so zufrieden bin und sogar einige Vorteile sehe, dass ich beim besten Willen keinen Grund finde den horrenden Preis zu bezahlen, den Apple sich fragt. Da fängt der Spaß ja erst bei 150,-€ aufwärts an, während die Btootos keine 30,-€ kosten. Dafür definitiv nochmal einen halben Stern, so dass ich mit gutem Gewissen die fünf Sterne geben kann. Wie lange diese Geräte halten, wird sich zeigen. Möglicherweise zeigt sich da irgendwann, dass Apple den Preis zu Recht und nicht nur für den Namen verlangt, aber an dieser Stelle kann ich nur eine klare Kaufempfehlung aussprechen.

Relación calidad-precio espectacular. Los compré en una oferta del Black Friday y estoy muy satisfecho. El emparejamieno cumple, se escuchan bastante bien para lo que valen, y la bateria dura lo suyo. Además el poder ver el porcentaje en números hace más cómodo seguir el nivel de carga que tienen. Personalmente me compré los rojos, tienen un acabo muy bonito. Las almuohadillas lo hacen bastate cómodo para llevar. Muy recomendables.

I am an almost permanent user of earbuds but tend to look to those with active noise cancelling and good sound quality. I am currently using Bose Qc 2's and (as ever) the reproduction is great but the mic quality is awful.Generally I've found that cheaper earbuds provide a better balance, reproduction is ok with a better mic quality for outgoing calls.I keep the ""high end"" earbuds with me all of the time but sometimes I may forget to take them so I keep ""emergency spare earbuds"" in my vehicles ""just in case.""These were recommended to me by a friend and so far I have been pleasantly surprised.Reproduction is reasonable and outgoing call quality  is great.They are not my style for comfortable fit (like Apple earbuds) however they are not uncomfortable either.The case is very small and charged with usb c.So for the purpose that they were bought for I am very happy.

I originally bought this because I’m using a Xiaomi phone. I’m not usually one to write reviews, but I accidentally put it through both the washer and dryer (one of them was in one of my pockets). I didn’t realize until I found it while folding clothes. I was terrified it wouldn’t work anymore, but to my surprise, it still works perfectly! Definitely worth a 5-star review.
"
"
Nice design, the sound is not the best but it’s ok for the price. Last battery is acceptable. The worst thing is doesn’t have button. If you miss the charger case it’s very hard to use them! You can not answer calls trough the earbuds and you can’t hang up calls is not very comfortable. That is the reason that I give 4 starts instead 5

Can't fit my ears, falls off all the time

Bueno y barato

It has good sound and the battery life is very good, which I recommend. I dropped 1 hearing aid in the water and I realized about 3 minutes later and I put them on and they worked without any problem.I've been using them for 2 months because the price is a good hearing aid.

Incómodos no se escucha fuerte molestan nada ergonomics no lo recomiendo para nada

Se escucha perfectísimo, justo ahora estoy escuchando musica para escribir reseñas mensas,calidad de audio,el unico punto malo que solo es lujo es que aveces(no se si sea de los audífonos o las apps de musica) es muy difícil que funcione el pausado,solo saltar canciones(cuando acomodo los audífonos termino saltando música por lo sensible que es)

Cycled through quite a few prior to owning these. Absolutely love them. Great standby and in use times. Excellent audio and great portability.

La batterie tient très bien, il se connecte facilement et le son est parfait pour le prix

Hallo Leute. Für 14 Euro,  sehr guter Sound. Nicht schlechter wie ein 100 euro ohrhörer.  Mit eine bass verstärker app, wird es  noch etwas besser.. dieses ist keine feek Bewertung, wie einige anderen.
"
"
These earbuds are awesome compared with others I had, these are way superior! They are very lightweight, don't fall from my ears like others, have a very good external noise reduction, and sound is crisp and clear.
"
"
These $47 earbuds sound better, have better active noise cancellation and are all around so much better than the $249.99 earbuds I bought have a touchscreen case (that I shall not mention the name because I am still a huge supporter of of this company). I'm a sound engineer (for live sound) so when I want to put in earbuds I want them to be the best. And so far these are it for me. Though you can not get the app in America so to access all the features, it doesn't matter. Redmi (English version) earbuds are where it's at...... Side note. I live in America, however I do have the supportive app because I have a VPN from Thailand.But like I said, it doesn't really matter if you can get the supportive app or not. I still give the 7 out of 5 stars (yes, I know what I did there).

Bought this for my wife as a gift, she likes the Xiaomi buds line, the sound quality is very good for what you are paying for, material quality feels good on touch, I personally like the case, they are easy to set up, even tho the buds app is region locked where I live (Central America) we had no issues connecting to BT and controlling them from there, best bang for your buck, performance is  good too.
"

Se escucha a la perfección, pero no es compatible con otra marca de celular
"
"
Los compré para hacer deporte y han sido muy utiles, su ANC no es muy invasivo pero tampoco permite que entren sonidos externos. La batería es excelente y sus funciones tactiles me gustaron mucho, lo unico ""malo"" es que las medidas de los tapones de auricular no son estandar y me quedan sueltos los S pero los M ya son incómodos (cosa que no pasa con sony, jbl, etc) pero para el precio, vale un montón. Productazo.
"
"
Funciona muy bien, recomendados
"

The app doesn't work in usa
"

the noise cancellation does not really work. can still hear the noise regardless of the noise cancellation settings. the noise cancellation is much worse compared to the xiaomi bud 3 pro (35db)By default, the ear bud cannot connect to two devices. you have to download the xiaomi app to change that.The battery life is also shorter than xiaomi bud 3 pro.

Muy buena calidad precio, tiene buena cancelación de ruido y buenos bajos para el precio, no hubo ningún problema con el envío y buena batería
"
"
Audífonos súper económicos, pero con gran calidad en el audio, cómodos, les dura muchísimo la batería, varias opciones de configuración. Funcionan perfecto!
"
"
Son muy cómodos , la cancelación de ruido es decente para el precio, el sonido es muy buena , el estuche es muy bonito y los audífonos ni que se diga, los he tenido casi 5-6 horas seguidos y no me han molestado.
"

Confesso que a qualidade de sincronização não é a das melhores, apresenta falhas em alguns momentos. Não sei se é devido a qualidade da operadora no Brasil ou ao fone em si. Bateria de longa duração, acabamento Premium e um bom custo benefício. Um ponto negativo além da falha na conexão as vezes, com pequenas travadas ou oscilações no som é que a caixa que acompanha o aparelho é extremamente frágil e fina. O manuseio deve ser cuidadoso inclusive ao abrir para não estragar a caixinha. Mas acredito que seja uma boa compra no final.

I've bought a couple different TOZO headphones in the past several years, but the T6 has been my favorite go-to pair. I've been using the same pair of earbuds for 2 years now and they work perfectly for everyday use. I like the slim case which is really convenient to take everywhere but still durable. The magnets that snap the case shut and hold the earbuds are pretty strong. Mine has survived being tossed around plenty as well as being accidentally put through the laundry. No damage or lost earbuds.The earbuds themselves fit well and have good sound quality, and the battery lasts a long time. Even if you use them all days, they're quick to charge in the case again. If you want a reliable, inexpensive pair of earbuds, these are basically perfect.

My 3rd set of Tozo ear buds. I really like Tozo! These are the best yet.Pros: Sound is terrific, as good as my Pixel budsCharge lasts forever (all day without putting them back in the case)Wireless chargingThey are *not* noise cancelling (which to me is an advantage), but the app comes with various white noise ""tracts"" which can accomplish the same thing. With normal use, I can hear things around me, but I have to take them out to have a discussionApp allows you to adjust the equalizer to your preferencesTips to fit any ear canalReally comfortable, maybe not as small as the A2 mini, but much better soundStay in my ears when I exerciseWaterproof (IPX8), so I can listen to podcasts or the news when I'm showering or walking the dog in the rainStable bluetooth connectionTozo--great value and great customer serviceCons:Even though they're pretty s. Buymall, my ideal bud would be one that was small enough to be unnoticeable.Still,  premium sound is more important than size, and, as I've said, these are really comfortable to wear

I've been using the TOZO T6 earbuds for a few weeks now, and overall, they work fairly well for casual listening. The sound quality is decent, though it does have a slightly tinny feel, especially with higher frequencies. It’s not a dealbreaker for me, but if you’re an audiophile, you might notice the difference.The most significant issue I've encountered is with the pairing process. If you don't pull both earbuds out of the case almost simultaneously, they won't link together, which can be quite frustrating. I’ve had to put them back in the case and start over more times than I’d like.On the plus side, the battery life is solid. I use them for a couple of hours at a time, and they’ve never gone dead on me. They’re also comfortable to wear and stay in place during workouts, which is a big plus.Overall, they’re a decent option for the price, but the connectivity quirk is something to be aware of.
"
"
I’ve been using the Tozo T6 earbuds for about three weeks now, and I’m really happy with them. Here’s the scoop:Design & Comfort: These earbuds look sleek and are super comfy. They come with multiple ear tip sizes, so you can get a perfect fit. The charging case is compact and fits easily in your pocket.Sound Quality: For the price, the sound quality is impressive. The audio is clear and balanced, and the bass is decent. They work great for music, podcasts, and calls.Battery Life: The battery life has been solid. I get about 6 hours of use per charge, and the case extends that to around 30 hours. The quick charge feature has been handy, too.Connectivity & Controls: Pairing with my phone has been smooth, thanks to Bluetooth 5.3. The touch controls are easy to use once you get used to them.Water Resistance: One of the best features: I’ve used these earbuds in the shower, and they’ve held up perfectly. The IPX8 rating really works, handling water and sweat with no issues.One thing to note is that the Tozo T6 doesn’t have active noise cancellation. If you’re looking for earbuds that block out external noise, you might want to consider other options.Overall: After three weeks of use, the Tozo T6 earbuds are still delivering great sound, impressive battery life, and solid durability. They’re a fantastic option if you’re looking for quality earbuds without spending a fortune, though keep in mind they lack noise cancellation.

These in earbuds are one of my favorites. I have a few different TOZO earbuds and these are by far one of the best. They literally cancel all the sound around you. I normally only wear one at a time because of the fact that they are so noise canceling.They connect very well, they are lightweight and very comfortable. They fit very good and don't move or fall out of my ears. They charge great and literally one earbud last almost all day. I don't have to charge it that often and I use it almost all day long. All in all great brand great product!!!I had a problem with one of my earbuds suddenly sounded muffled. There was no water even near them... Even though they are waterproof. So I emailed TOZO and customer service was wonderful. I purchased these back in July and they helped me through resetting them and my earbud works perfectly fine now. I really love this brand and they have very good earbuds. I have different styles I recommend TOZO for sure.
"
"
One of the best earbuds on the market. The fact that the price is inexpensive is genius. Easy to set up through bluetooth and app. The sound is crisp and bass is nice and balanced. The weight of the case is super light and its easily concealable in your pocket. The stability is pretty strong for a item this light. It comes in different colors but i like black as my default. Paired up with the Tozo app you can customize your sound the way you like. My first Tozos were the NC7s and those were so good but i like the new T6s better. All around i trust the Tozo brand because it hasn't let me down so far. Thanks guys!

La verdad es sorprendente el sonido y la calidad de este producto, son ya 3 que compro (unos para mi, y 2 para regala), y me sigue sorprendiendo su relación costo/beneficio, no le piden NADA a las marcas de ""gama alta"", soy DJ profesional desde hace mas de 34 años, he usado audífonos de todo tipo, y estos (en su rubro), son los mejores que he usado. LLAMA YA !

The Tozo T6 wireless earbuds offer impressive sound quality, deep bass, and a comfortable fit. With a reliable touch control system, IPX8 water resistance, and decent battery life, they're great for everyday use. The Bluetooth 5.0 ensures a stable connection. A solid choice for those seeking affordable, quality earbuds with essential features.

Le son est bon. Le maintien est bon. La durée d'écoute n'est pas négligeable. Le design est beau. Le rapport qualité/prix est plus que correct.

It's second pair of Tozo T6 earbuds and only becuase I lost the first pair.I had the first pair for around 18 months, no problem, never faulty, battery was great.I like them as they don't feel cheap, sound is great and they come with huge selection of eartips. I have a small ears and most of the earbuds on the market are too big for me!

I was a long holdout, sticking to my wired earbuds for the longest time. Then I upgraded to a phone without a headphone jack and decided it was time to get Bluetooth headphones. I bought this item because they came in different colors besides black and white and they were a relatively low price point.  I got them in the bright blue color.I love the way they look.They do not disappoint! They connect quickly and have surprisingly great sound!  They are not noise reducing, however the earpieces fit so well in my ears that it makes it hard to hear people or noises around me unless my volume is down very low or I take one earbud out of my ear.I really like the charging indicator on the front. They charge using a USB-C cord (included) OR by placing the case on a Qi charger.  The cord charges them way faster,  but I like having the flexibility of both means.I liked these so much I got another set in a different color for my teenage son. I figured if he broke or lost them, they're not a significant cost to replace. (Also the reason I trusted myself with them.)Of course it would be ME who left the earbuds in a pocket of shorts that I then put through the washing machine.  Oops. BUT I put them immediately into a bag of rice to draw out the moisture. Impatiently,  I took them out two hours later to charge and try again.  They worked! The sound was muffled at first but now that it has been a few days since the sound is back to normal.I do NOT recommend washing them, nor wearing them in water, but they made it though one accidental washing.I am super impressed that these things held up so well to my carelessness, and have great sound and functionality.  I would buy these again and would absolutely recommend them to a friend.

Sometimes I'm amazed by the advancements in wireless and micro technology, especially when it comes to audio. These popped up in an email from Amazon a few days ago. Though I usually ignore those Deal notices this one intrigued me. I have a JBL Everest over-ear headset that I love for indoor phone calls and they're pretty good for music too (though I don't use them that way). I often like to go outside when I'm on the phone and the JBLs aren't convenient to use with a stocking cap, so I'd thought briefly about getting something in-ear to wear under my hat. These were $35 and the reviews were good. I liked that the case wirelessly charges the ear buds, and the case can be charged wirelessly too. My Samsung phone has wireless charging so I already have two wireless chargers and they're very convenient (especially given that the USB port on my phone was getting sketchy). So I figured I'd give them a try. I played a variety of my favorite music. I first asked for Jeff Buckley live music and the first song that started playing as I stepped outside was ""Hallelujah."" I walked around the property listening to my favorite music and before I knew it I had been listening to music for about three hours. I had really only cared about the sound quality for phone calls and whether they would stay in my ears (which is usually a problem for me). They never came close to falling out and they are comfortable. For phone calls the sound quality is very good on both ends. And though they're rated as having a 33' range I walked all around the house and got considerably farther than that from my phone with two walls separating the devices and I had no dropouts. Overall I am so happy with them that after a week of using them I ordered a backup pair.I have three VERY minor niggles but even combined I wouldn't consider them significant enough to knock off even ½ star. First, I had trouble gripping them well enough to get them out of the case quickly when I got an unexpected phone call. I started leaving them on a paper towel on the table next to me, but it now seems I've discovered the right way to grip them. Second, though they have a voice announcement of which side is which when first removed from the case, I was concerned that I might confuse L and R as they don't appear to have any visible indicators. My solution was to use my fine-point permanent marker to write an L on the left one. Third, one of my wireless phone chargers is a tilted stand that holds my phone at a convenient angle. I was unable to get the Ear buds case to wirelessly charge on that one until last night when I accidentally discovered that the problem was that the case was too small to hit the sweet spot on the charger. I solved the problem by boosting the case up with a pad of mini sticky notes (as shown in the photo).EDIT (I apologize if I forget to come back to delete my previous review):None of the above has changed but I forgot to mention that these are NOT good for noise isolation (at least not the way they fit me) but I prefer it that way. I'm a musician and music sounds less natural to me when the surrounding environment is completely eliminated, and I like being able to have a conversation or hear a knock at the door without removing them. Even without a tight seal I never have to reseat them and the sound quality stays consistent (a first for me after trying several other brands).UPDATE: I've been using these ear buds for five weeks now. I use them for hours every day and they continue to impress me. On three occasions only the right channel had a signal when I initially put them in to listen to music, but each time I put them back in the case and took them out again (which turned them off and on) and they worked normally. I've only had this happen with music and only when I first take them out of the case (i.e. it hasn't happened while on a call or after I've been listening to music with both working).

Quality of sound is really good. I have no issues with quality.Price is very reasonable. Holds charge for a long time. Fits well in the ear. The only issue for which I deducted one star is that it does not have USB C charging, you have to use its own charging cable which is a nuisance/inconvenience.

I love that I was able to pick the color I wanted. These are the first earbuds that work just like they said they would. I took a walk today and had music the whole time I was walking. The sound is wonderful and they are easy to pair with your phone. I also loved the price of these!

I have a blue pair of these. They work great. I like that the case charges the ear pods, so if you use them for a long while, just put them back in the case and it recharges. Just be sure the case is charged before heading out. The charge lasts for a bit, too. It has a great sound. Love the assorted colors and best of all, Great Price

I don't go out of my way to leave a lot of reviews. But I figured I was so impressed with these that I would go ahead and leave a review. I purchased these a few days ago and I'm extremely pleased with the whole experience. Let me tell you the reasons why. I have something that you might describe as a shopping addiction lol. When I'm looking to purchase something, I will spend hours looking at every option before I finally pull the trigger. It was no different with this purchase. When going online and looking for earbuds that are less than $30, there are hundreds of choices. Most of them have great reviews and seem to be made pretty well. What sets these apart from the others are some pretty cool features.First, these will work with Siri through the earbud itself and not through the cell phone. Most inexpensive earbuds only work with Siri if you click it four times which is very difficult to do. These will work just like your airpods work. Which for me, is really cool since I used these for biking. I don't have to be clicking anything 4 times to skip songs or to play something different. And before anybody starts, I only put one in my right ear at a low level so I can hear traffic coming lol.They definitely hold the charge well. Which is good, because it's a pain in the neck for cheaper earbuds to have to be charging them every time you use them for a few hours. Also, the sound quality is absolutely amazing for the money. I have about four or five different sets of earbuds and one of them is an Apple Airpod. I don't know which generation. But I do know that these sound a little better than all of them. If you like deep bace and Crystal Clear sound, you'll love these. They have all that and more.They also have an app that you can use as an equalizer. You can use the 16 preset ones that are offered and they also post hundreds of other equalizer programs that you can try on your own. Of course you can also do your own custom equalizer . This is really cool for me since Apple Music does not offer an equalizer. Only the one on my IPhone 14+ and theirs is better.They will also do wireless charging, which I'm not sure if I'm happy about that or not since I don't ever use it. I guess I should try it. Pretty much most better phones all come with wireless charging these days. It seems to be the wave of the future. so I’ll go out and get a wireless charger after searching online for hours lol.The app that you have to download also has one button that you click to register for an 18-month warranty. Which is pretty cool since most sub $50 earbuds don't offer anything like this at all. From what I've read, their customer service is pretty decent, let's hope that's true.The case is also a little bit smaller than most of the others that I have. Which I like since I can fit them into my pocket easily. They also have the battery charged status on the cover. All my others do not have this. I have to guess whether they're going to last or not when I take them out for the day. So this feature I really like. I’ve used them for four or five hours at a time and not had any issues with the charge status going below 20%. They also come with six sets of very comfortable earbuds caps. I'm not sure of the cool name, but you get the idea.The earbuds connect effortlessly to my phone. I was happy with that since I have others that are real hassle to get them moving. A few of them, I have to open and close the case several times to get them to connect. Keep in mind this might be me because I’m kind of an idiot at times. But at least I’m honest lol. I've also gone into several different rooms 30 to 40 ft away and I didn't lose any connections. I have a few sets of earbuds that are always fading in or out if I sneeze the wrong way.A lot of these Amazon purchases that have glowing reviews are because the seller is somehow monetarily enticing people to leave a great review. I purchased these on my own at the full price and nobody is asking me to write anything lol. But since I was so impressed, I figured I would just fill you in on my thoughts.As far as longevity though, I don't really know. But I'm guessing they'll hold up pretty well. But in my mind, I can just buy another set if they become broken or lost and keep doing that for about 5 years before I get to the price of one set Apple Airpod lol. I can promise you that you will love these. Good luck and thank you for reading.

I picked these ear buds up based off of the raving reviews and I am not disappointed! These by far exceed my needs. I only use these to listen to music and for my workouts so I can't say how they are during phone calls. For music, they are great and sound a lot more expensive. They stay in my ears, and I have had no connection issues while I am active. I was surprised by how light they are so you don't really even notice them. One of my favorite features is the battery level displayed on the case when you open and close the lid. I can't tell you how many times I grab an older set I have, pop them in just to see the battery levels are low. I often don't even see the battery level until I run out the door and connect them to my phone. With these, I get a battery level reading at first glance. It even has wireless charging. The only downside with the wireless charging for me is I have a charging station that props your device up. and the case has the wireless charging connection on the bottom of the case. I have to set this case up facing on it's side which is not ideal. You can see in a picture I provided. This won't be an issue if you have a wireless charging pad. My other earbud case has wireless charging on the back side of the case so you can place it face up on a pad or facing out on the prop up charger. Either way it still works so I can't knock it too much. The noise cancelling is not active, so I feel these are not the best in that class. Overall, I highly recommend the Tozo T20 if you want earbuds that are affordable, sound amazing, have great battery, and are super comfortable!

I've been using these TOZO T20 for several weeks and I'm really enjoying them. Some of the reasons:--They connected easily to my phone and computer, as well as the TOZO app.--The charging case works great, and I love the LED power indicator. The case can be charged via USB or wirelessly. It’s also small and seems durable so far.--Battery life has been excellent.--They’re comfortable. And they stay securely in place, even during workouts.--The sound is quite good. Very clear and rich.--I’ve used them for both phone and video calls and have had no complaints– the dual mics with noise reduction perform admirably.--The TOZO app allows you to adjust EQ settings for different genres and listening situations. Very cool.--Lastly, you really can’t beat the price!I’d highly recommend them.

o fone é muito bom, a bateria durou pouco mais de 1 semana, e olhe que utilizo bastante.Às vezes ocorre algumas interferências ""tipo bugs"", não sei o motivo, mas o alcance dele é muito bom, uns 20 metros. Mas já ocorreram vezes de estar próximo ao meu dispositivo e estar falhando a conexão.o som do produto é muito bom, estou satisfeita.

Me baño con ellos y cero problemas tengo mas de 6 meses con ellos

Le uso quando suono la batteria, isolano bene il suono esterno e la qualità del suono è ottima con bassi ben definiti. Custodia robusta ed utilissima la visualizzazione della % di carica. Arrivano con 6 set di gommini dalla XXS all XXL ed un cavettino di ricarico molto corto poco ingombrante.

Son unos auriculares increíbles, un sonido magnífico con unos graves profundos, compatibles con la aplicación TOZO desde donde se pueden configurar y descargar actualizaciones.También son muy cómodos y con una duración de la batería muy extensa.Altamente recomendables

Der Sound ist klasse, sieht auch gut aus, mein Case hatte beim Aufladen immer bei 94 % aufgehört, habe mich an den Support Gewand aber geholfen hat er nun nicht wirklich , nachdem ich anderes Kabel benutzt hatte, funktionierte das aufladen zu 100%, das andere Kabel war aber nicht meins, sondern nur zum Testen, habe mir daraufhin eines gekauft, hätte mich auf eine kleine Gutschrift gefreut, aber nun ja, es ist wie es ist

I acquired my first set of these by happenstance…. My neighbor had gotten them for her boyfriend and they broke up before they arrived, so she asked if I wanted them. I figured I’d give them a try and said yes, and I’m very glad I did! I’m not an audiophile, nor do I have much of a budget, so I was rocking my three year old Jaybird Vistas still, which I loved for the sound quality, but after having completed my college degree primarily by Zoom during the pandemic, my ears were hurting after extended wear and I wasn’t sure where to go from there. These little earbuds surprised me with their high quality sound and how insanely comfortable they were in my ears. I don’t need a high level of sound dampening but they work great in the train tunnel during my commute, and I can still hear well enough when they’re in Transparency mode. Using the app is easy and personalizes the buds to my preferences, and they have a fantastic range which can handle the bass in dance, rock, and whatever else I’m listening to, even at higher volumes. Plus, when I receive calls, the other person can hear me clearly! I’ve never had them fall out of my ears except for when I’ve accidentally dislodged them by bumping them, but even then it’s a rare occurrence and they’ve never broken. (I’m only on a second set because my wife absconded with my first set and has refused to give them up, even over her AirPods Pro, so I figured I better order my own…. Happy wife, happy life, right?) The battery life is also  crazy in the best way…. I’ve only had to charge them a handful of times in almost a year, and I use them at least a couple of hours a day. In my opinion, you’ll really have a  time finding a better pair of earbuds for the money.

These are the best earbuds I've ever bought. Soundcore has definitely gained a customer after this. Audio is crisp and clean especially if the LDAC feature is activated. The bass is excellent. Everything is just so well balanced. I really love the app the soundcore app too. It makes everything easier as you can easily adjust everything to your liking from there. Connectivity is not a problem either. I can go quite a distance around the house without worrying about it being disconnected. Best of all is the battery life. The buds normally last me all day and the case lasts me all week before charging. All in all 10/10. It's worth every dime.

EDIT (July 30): Unfortunately, the same thing is still happening in phone calls: my voice stops coming through for the person on the other end of the line after 7-10 minutes and I need to switch my mic from my headphones to my phone and back to the headphones again. I do like the size and quality of these earbuds so I'm going to keep them, but I probably won't purchase again. Full review below!EDIT (July 18): The seller provided me with a prompt replacement pair at no cost, which was really nice. The audio quality of calls/recordings seems to be much improved, and I so far do not have the issues with calls disconnecting. I will continue to use these and will update again if the same issues arise—but so far, so good! Bumped my review up to a four-star.THINGS I LOVE:I'm impressed with the sound quality, noise cancellation, comfort, and customizable touch commands on these earbuds. Of course the sound quality won't match top-of-the-line over-ear headphones and you won't get studio sound, but these are pretty darn solid in terms of sound quality. Crisp and full. I use these on the subway and the noise-cancelling is enough that I can keep the volume at a comfortable level—rather than cranking the volume up like I did on my old AirPods. There are multiple noise-cancelling modes and you can even turn noise-cancelling off if it freaks you out. Overall, I'm very happy with how these sound.They also come with every size of ear tips so you can get a snug but comfy fit. The intuitive accompanying app is not necessary, but I used it to customize touch commands to raise/lower volume, skip ahead or back, and play/pause. Really simple to use, and easy to create gestures that make sense for your use case.Battery life is pretty amazing too. I got these a few weeks ago, charged up the case, and haven't had to charge it again yet. These aren't my main headphones, but I've used them almost every day for walks, errands, exercise, and commuting. Very impressive battery life so far.They've also been pretty tolerant of exercise sweat, though I will say that they were acting possessed for an hour after getting sweaty. These were more comfortable and sound-immersive than my old AirPods for workout music, but my AirPods held up better to sweat. These still win for me in that category, though, because of the ANC and the fact that they didn't fall out of my head and go flying off the treadmill belt underneath me.So mostly, I love these.THE MAJOR PROBLEM, THOUGH:Now, the flaw—which would be a dealbreaker if these weren't only $60 and such a dream otherwise—THESE ARE UNUSABLE FOR CALLS. I actually CANNOT use them for phone calls. The audio quality sounds ""underwater"" as my friends and family put it over the phone, and my audio quality tests yield the same results.Even worse, they randomly stop sending my audio signal every seven or eight minutes. So I'll pick up the phone while out for a walk, talk with poor audio quality for a few minutes, and then the person on the other end of the line suddenly does the whole ""Ohp, I think you cut out—you there? Hello? Can you hear me?"" And I need to switch my audio source to my phone, then back to the headphones. This happens every few minutes for the entire call. It's such a pain that I can't put myself or phone friends through it anymore. I don't even talk on the phone often, but this is a big enough problem that I might have to replace these.One of the reasons I bought these was to have reliable earbuds for work calls and phone calls, but these don't work for those scenarios. It's really too bad, because these are SO GREAT (especially for the price) otherwise.NOTE: See my updated edit at the top of this review.

Synopsis: Great set of earbuds with decent noise deafening, decent transparency, great sound, great size, awesome battery life, and good comfort!Sound: These earbuds sound very good! I'm not the audiophile I used to be, but they seemed to handle Rock, Folk/Indie, and Podcasts quite well! As far as noise canceling and transparency, they seem to work quite well! I often only wear one bud around the house or at work so I can hear someone if they walk up to me. They are the first set with NC/transparency and I really enjoy the transparency setting, not perfect, but quite impressive to me! Noise canceling has been nice when working on the car and running an impact wrench to deaden the sound some, but they are not silent by any means.Form factor: I love the size of the case, as my last set was the Spirit X2s, so these fit much more comfortablely in my pocket. They have quite a few ear tip sizes and between the comfort and the transparency, they are much easier to forget you are wearing than other buds I have owned. I am not really a fan of the touch button function, but it is generally functional and customizable in the app. It does become annoying when you want to push the bud in your ear, as it registers the touch as a button push.Overall, I am quite impressed with these, especially seeing as how they go on sale less than $50!

A qualidade deste fone é excelente. Testei ele na estrada e além do áudio fantástico, não conseguia ouvir praticamente nada do motor do carro e do barulho da rodovia. A interface do app para celular é muito boa e simples. Fácil de configurar e usar. A bateria tem durado muito. Fiquei mais de um mês sem carregar e a bateria do estojo sempre preenchia a bateria do fone para 100%. O preço não é dos mais favoráveis, mas a qualidade vale o preço sim. Ah, outra coisa importante: se você costuma jogar muito ou assistir a vídeos, este fone tem uma das menores taxa de lag do mercado. Além do modo jogo, que reduz o lag ainda mais, o modo normal já deixa o lag praticamente imperceptível. Esta foi a principal razão de eu ter comprado este fone, o atraso mínimo, que eu não consigo notar. E o isolamento de ruído dele ganhou excelentes avaliações como uma das melhores do mercado.

I'm writing this review while waiting for my second purchase of the Space A40. No, there wasn't anything wrong with the first purchase. Rather I was so satisfied with the first one - which has become my wife has commandeered - that I didn't have to reconsider getting a second one.I personally think five-star reviews should generally be taken with caution, but here I would like to qualify and detail why the Space A40 deserves five stars overall.First, I give the audio quality/noise cancellation four stars, compared to say, the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones (better sound, better noise cancelling) or Apple's AirPods Pro (2nd gen.) (less satisfying sound, better Transparency/Adaptive noise cancelling modes). The important things to keep in mind in these comparisons is that the Sony cost about three times as much, and generally full-sixed over-ear headphones sound better than earbuds. Plus, the XM4 was once Sony's flagship in the Bluetooth noise-cancelling headphones category, so it's more effective if you want to shut out the world, and envelop yourself in a rich, albeit a little bass-heavy audio environment. In comparison, the Space A40 gives you a balanced, quality sound and lets in a bit more of ambient sounds. As an analogy, the Sony XM4 is like using blackout curtains in a big auditorium, while using the A40 is like you're in a smaller venue with room-darkening curtains.Next, the AirPods Pro. Its strengths are that it works very well with iPhones, iPads, and Macs in general, and if you're an Apple Music subscriber like me, they work flawlessly with Apple's Spatial Audio. In terms of noise cancelling, Apple's very good Transparency mode is now superseded by its new Adaptive mode, which actively moderates the sound environment such that you can hear both music and ambient sounds well enough. But note ""enough."" This phrase pretty much sums up the audio performance and noise cancelling abilities of the AirPods. They give you good enough sound but the Space A40 is more subtle, balanced, and present; no point comparing the AirPods to the Sonys. The AirPods cancel noise just about as good as the Space A40; again, don't compare it to the Sonys. Oh, but the price tag! if you take price into the comparison, then the AirPods would drop out of the race immediately. It is obscenely overpriced. The only reason why I even own the AirPods Pro is that they were free gifts as part of another purchase. Going back to the curtains analogy: the AirPods are super futuristic - and expensive - curtains that automatically filter light going into a small venue but cannot fully darken the room. You pay for the look and the automatic filtering feature.So where does that leave the Space A40? An eminently sensible choice when you consider everything else. The Soundcore app is very polished and feature-laden and allows you to customize the use and the sound of the A40 to a very large extent, surpassing both Sony and Apple. Add to that the A40's battery life, a very pocketable case that charges wirelessly as well as via cable with clear indicator lights, and the overall good construction, you'd wonder why anyone would bother looking at anything else.Hence, a solid five stars.

Léger, qualité sonore très bonne, bonne autonomie. Pas le mieux au niveau tenu dans l oreille pour faire un footing (comme tous ces types d écouteurs intra auriculaire) sinon rien à dire.

Tl;dr - Here’s what you probably came here to find out:- Sound quality is phenomenal. Deep bass and rich crystal clear highs. Hands down better than AirPods Pro 2, and significantly so imo.- Battery life is the longest I’ve ever experienced, once again shaming Apple.- Noise cancelling is great. For this, I’d say it’s equal to AirPods Pro 2, if not slightly better.- They fit very snugly in my ears and don’t fall out with movement. They come with three pairs of ear tips, each a different size.- Very good construction and premium feel. They also look really good.- The charging case can either be charged with a type-C wire, or on any wireless charger by laying them down on the charging pad.- The Skullcandy IQ app is actually useful with features such as custom EQ, voice control configuration, ANC controls, etc.Long version:Borrowed my Wife’s AirPods Pro 2 off and on for a week before deciding to give these a go as they were 50% off, and as someone who listens to metal and hard rock, these things absolutely murder Apple’s flagship buds. As far as sound quality and loudness, going from the AirPods Pro 2 to these was like going from ramen noodles to premium ribeye. The bass is right where it should be, and the treble is crystal clear and clean. Loud is an understatement. I use Spotify Premium and am happy with the EQ within that app, but the EQ within the Skullcandy app is really great as well. These are made well and feel great. Battery is roughly 6-7 hours, so really great. They fit great, are very comfortable, and don’t fall out with movement. All in all, these buds are amazing. Apple can’t compete.

I love the volume and Bass on these guys. The different size tips are perfect..well for me they are, they stay in my ears no matter what I'm doing , the app is helpful.  The equalizer is awesome. I'd love louder, but that's just my preference, I want it to rattle my brain literally, they're loud, don't get me wrong. Only dislike, more of a little annoyance is, they're very touchy, it's not a deal breaker, I've gotten used to it already. They last all day as far as battery, my right seems to ALWAYS  drain quicker, it's weird, but again, not a deal breaker. I will honestly say, I've tried so many brands, and skullcandy is just IT , every aspect, skullcandy is IT. Keep it up skullcandy , great job. Can't wait to see what's next.
"
"
Are they comparable to some of the top brands? If you consider price, they may be better. My previous buds include Bose and Samsung so this is the basis for my comparison. Pairing was uneventful and the Skull IQ app is easy to use. ANC and Stay Aware feature work as advertised. Fit is comfortable and secure. Audio is more than acceptable; especially is you use the Skull IQ app to customize the sound as well as the included hearing test portion of the app to create a personalized profile.  For those that suggest there is not enough bass, I recommend using the app to customize the sound and make sure that the buds are tightly fitted. I would buy them again for the price I paid (not sure why but my price was 49.88 new). Might shop harder at the $89 current price.

Edit: added more at the endIf you had an allergic reaction to Samsung Buds 2 or their other earbuds, you'll react to these as well. I wore the Rail ANC for less than one afternoon and by dinner my ears were already reacting with liquid discharge. This morning at 4am I had one ear almost totally crusted over and still leaking while the other was leaking but less crusted. I've had this reaction before and I suspect it's the material used for the inserts. Also, the little logo they put on them didn't help either. Anything that causes friction in the ear canal is a stupid idea. I got these for a trip I'm taking on a plane across country and I'm kinda screwed now because I can't return them in time to get something else. My old wired headphones from when I bought my Samsung pgone don't react, so I took those ear inserts and luckily they fit, so I through them on. Once my ears stop reacting and chill out, I'll see if that fixes the issue in time for my trip.As far as function goes, the headphones are okay at best. They can get plenty loud to the point that ANC or their Stay Aware pass through mode mean nothing. It's nice to know I can listen at lower volumes like I prefer and still have ambient noise be mostly audible or have anc keep things subdued. But subdued is the best they give and mostly audible ambient noise is about as much as you can expect. These aren't stellar at either. Doable, but not something I'd laude about.They sound pretty good for what they are. Not sure if I'd say they're $100 headphone quality or value, allergies aside, but they don't sound awful by any means. Music was clear and had some rumble. I used the sound personalization and it was easy enough to get decent sound. There a bass boost, general music and podcast sound setting with a customizable equalizer in the app as well.The buttons on the side are touch activated and finicky. I tend to tap fast and expect fast responses, but these prefer a more methodical pace. The sweetspot for where to touch is also funky, but I started getting it after a few hours. Also, the audio queues are clear enough, but an option to remove them would make things feel faster. Also, if they're not in my ear, I wish touch capacity stopped. Plenty of time I took one out and accidentally started changing tracks, changing volume and activating pairing mode.I remapped all the touch responses and even changed what ear did what. One tap on either paused, double tap on left was volume down, on right it's volume up.  Three taps left was previous track and same on the right was skip ahead. Long press in either toggles ANC on/off and pass through audio. I appreciate customization like that.For what stands out as good, I'd say it's the voice prompts. Much quicker to respond than on my phone or watch and that's kinda sad because it's the feature I'll probably never use and cared rhe least about, but seemed so much better than my phones inbuilt assistant that Samsung spent so much time, effort and money on to develop (rip bixby). If you like using voice commands, that's gonna go great, although the ""take photo"" command doesn't work with my Samsung's camera app. Again, not something I was after anyways.One of my favorite features was the built-in tile function for finding them if I lose one or both. The tile app isn't super intuitive, but I mostly figured it out and stumbled my way into it connecting both buds. It creates a tone I can hear when the room in my apartment is silent and has a directional sensor to let me know if I'm getting hotter or colder. Granted, it's not terribly responsive, sensitive or consistent, but if I moved slowly through a room, I bet between the proximity sensor and sound I'd probably find one if I lost one. It's a nice feature to have where I'd otherwise be totally screwed, so I'll take a win where I can with these.I got these on pre-order. When they were scheduled to release after 2 weeks, they ended up coming 10 days earlier or less. It seems weird i had to pre-order when people said they were already at Walmart for a couple weeks, but whatever.I'll update after my ears recover and try them using the non-reactive ear inserts from my old wired heaphones and see if they don't react again. I was furious about my Galaxy Buds 2 causing this reaction, but my wired stuff and my LG Tone Platinums never caused an issue. If it weren't summer and the LG Tone Platinums weren't makeing my neck hot, I might never have bothered looking at this style Bluetooth buds again. But it's a trip to a Nevada training center after the hottest july month on record in human history with averages around 110 in the area I'll be. I thought I'd take a chance on mild comfort. I'm hoping I didn't waste my money now that almost out of time.EDIT: It's been a few days so I'll add more input. Battery is pretty good, but it's not enough to bump a star.The app Skullcandy IQ is awful. It's what controls your key presses. The problem is the app is always on, but loses connection and resets all your programmed key presses. I end up having to reset them every day when they eventually connect poorly. The app logo constantly in my phones notification bar isn't necessary or tell me any input about my headphones. If it at least told me battery levels or connection status, maybe I wouldn't be so annoyed, but this just ISN'T ready for prime time.Also, the ear inserts are what caused the allergic reaction. They jerryrigged replacements I found by chance from a totally different set of wired buds from an old phone work well enough, but I shouldn't have to find my own replacements. At least having an option for different inserts that are non-reactive would be beneficial like memory foam or whatever. Again, Samsung Buds 2 had this EXACT issue and replacing inserts with an aftermarket set was the only solution. For a list of symptoms, it's pretty unmistakable: liquid discharge, discolored mucousal discharge in ear, weeping ear, flaking and scaly skim that seems to build up and shed, pain  itching, inflammation, basically a large skin irritation in your ear canal that, if unmanaged, becomes a severe ear infection. Samsung got sued for it and has been paying out for their affected customers. Skullcandy is headed the same way with these unless they have a hypoallergenic replacement in the wing.If the connectivity issue wasn't so bad and not saving my preset remapped button setting wasn't so annoying, perhaps I would add a star or two, but this isn't ready for release and I'm probably returning after giving another day or two. Really sucks I'm screwed out of my trip for headphones, but I'm not gonna struggle with a new set of buds I paid good money for. I'll just go back to wired at this point.

First of all, in the package are instructions that clearly explain what to do if one headphone doesn't connect. I almost didn't buy these because of the reviews of them not connecting. Those who were unable to figure this out I don't understand why.I primarily use these for working out, running, and casual listening. While working out and running I typically sweat a lot and have had no issues with connectivity issues, and most importantly fitment issues when I sweat. These feel really great in my ears and I am able to run for 90+ mins and not have to touch or adjust these or feel like they will fall out. I am really impressed with the fitment.Active noise cancellation (ANC) I absolutely love this. Occasionally I end up running in high traffic areas, and if I am listening to a podcast or audiobook while running it really does tune out all background noise. Even when I am sitting around the house or office and want to immerse myself in the music I totally can. It's really impressive.Battery: As soon as I got these I charged them up. It's been about 2 weeks and I have not had to plug them in to recharge the case yet. I have used these for about 10 hours total (not continuously) so the battery life is great in my opinion.Sound: I read a review that mentioned lack of bass and I don't know if people really love to have their brain rattling, but these have plenty of bass. It's also clear and not a muffled bass.Overall I paid less for these ANC Rails than I did. For my previous ""premium sound"" earbuds and these are significantly better. These are truly underrated earbuds.

El material del case se siente un poco frágil, sin embargo los auriculares se sienten mucho más resistentes.La duración de la batería con el sistema ANC activado es de más de 7 horas continuas. El volumen y la calidad del audio son bastante buenas, y el sistema de cancelación de ruido funciona excelente aún cuando no se está escuchando nada con ellos.La app para personalizar tanto las características de audio como los comandos de los audífonos es excelente y el sistema de comandos por voz funciona perfecto.Llegaron al día siguiente de pedirlos, estoy completamente satisfecho y hasta sorprendido con la compra.

La calidad del producto es increíble, son muy ligeros y cómodos, realmente merecen la pena. Si ANC es muy bueno y aísla realmente del ruido exterior. Lo único que tiene una opción que es solo y únicamente para Spotify, y no se puede usar con otros servicios de música, es lo único que hay queja.

Ease of use...very stong body case...Value for money... superb sound ...Good Quality item ... Nice features...I Love it.....

Ich liebe diese Kopfhörer. Empfehle definitiv die Version mit Rail ANC! Der Sound ist Bombe und die sitzen gut im Ohr ;)
"

Los compré por qué me gusta la atmósfera de Xiaomi con celular Poco y un smartwatch.Pero, creo que no son originales, la app de Xiaomi no los detecta, puedo decir que son una buena imitación tienen las mismas funciones que los originales, los compare con los de una reseña y si tienen variantes.Tienen buen sonido tanto para música como para llamadas, buen micrófono, valen la pena por el costo pero... Le dejo esas estrellas por lo de la app.
"

Excelente desempenho

Son muy cómodos, se ajusta muy bien al oído, tiene un excelente sonido y facil uso y conexión al celular, no trae cable de carga pero al ser tipo C se puede utilizar el del.movil muy buen producto
"

Calidad de sonido a muy buen precio, me sorprendió lo bien que suenan y tienen muy buen tacto de lo mejor por el precio que tiene.

Très bon écouteurs bonne qualité de son c est facilement connecté a mon tél Xiaomi contente de mon achat
"

I had to eq the sound too much to get a good balance because the earphones are too bright
"
"
Los primero que compré hace un par de años eran perfectos, el material era bueno y la calidad de Audio también, los tuve que volver a comprar por que un audífono se me cayo al agua. Debo decir que la calidad de estos últimos que compré se quedan muy por debajo de los anteriores, el material se siente mucho mas barato y el audio también es un poco malo, no los devolví por que se ajustan bien a mi oido y realmente los necesitaba.

O produto chegou 4 dias antes do prazo, ou seja, chegou bem rápido. Alguns pontos relevantes sobre o produto são:1) o áudio é bom. É claro que não tem a qualidade de um Airpod original ou uma Jbl, mas é aceitável. O som não fica falhando, a não ser que se distancie do aparelho que está conectado (celular, laptop, etc).2) o encaixe na orelha é ótimo. Veio com várias borrachas para ajustar o tamanho de acordo com a demanda.3) carrega relativamente rápido. A bateria parece durar um tempo, já que usei por um longo período e não acabou.4) prático e leve. Pode carregar no bolso da blusa ou da calça, pois a caixinha é pequena5) veio com carregador, as borrachas e até mesmo um pacotinho de jujubas (?? kkkkkk). Tudo certo com a embalagem, sem estragosConcluindo, o fone fornece o esperado para o valor  e vale a pena. 9/10! 👍

Adquirí estos audífonos para probar y debo admitir que han superado mis expectativas.Al principio, hubo unos detalles que me preocuparon como que solamente se sincronizaba un audífono o que se le acabó la batería a un solo audífono, pero ya tiene tiempo que funcionan muy bien.Probé los audífonos con un celular barato y la conexión no fue nada buena. Decidí usar mi celular de uso diario y la conexión mejoró, no es perfecta, pero sí permite escuchar la música casi sin interrupciones.Uso los audífonos cuando camino y/o viajo en el metro y funcionan bastante bien.Yo creo que por el precio que es sumamente bajo, estos audífonos ofrecen una excelente relación calidad-precio.
"
"
Très bien pour le prix !
"
"
Consiglio assolutamente. Prese un paio e durate due anni. Fatte comprare anche ad una collega. Ora riprese perché dopo essere cadute 3 volte non funzionavano piu bene. Prezzo eccezionale. Grandezza giusta. Suono perfetto. Coprono i rumori perfettamente
"
"
Hasta ahora los mejores auriculares bluetooth que he comprado. Funcionan muy bien, duran mucho conectados y el sonido es de calidad. Puede que no sean de altísima gama, pero ni falta que hace. Muy recomendables. Además por precio... Genial. Yo los uso para escuchar música y meditaciones, y ver películas o series de prime vídeo y estoy muy contento 😀. Gracias

Se escuchan excelente! Puedo hacer llamadas en ambiente con mucho ruido y me escuchan excelente! Muy feliz con mis audífonos los recomiendo

Rly good

I got the previous version redmi buds 3 pro from 2022 september and it was great. Needed to upgrade and have more features, but got a low quality product. I think $80 is too much for the performance.
"
"
The sound quality is fantastic. Unfortunately the noise cancellation is a joke :(((
"
"
La calid de sonido es muy buena, el diseño y los materiales son excelentes.Y a un precio muy razonable.
"
"
Originales, fáciles de instalar y de configurar, gran calidad en su sonido.
"
"
Ótimo produto! Até o momento eu tenho 1 mês de uso e está atendendo todos os meus requisitos, me deixando satisfeito com o produto.O áudio é incrivelmente bom, em todos os aspectos. Além de ser super resistente, pois já tive um certo descuido de deixar cair algumas vezes no chão, mas não ocorreu nenhum problema na case e nem nos fones em si!O único ponto fraco, é para quem gosta de usar o modo de cancelamento de ruído, pois o deste fone não é tão bom quanto algumas de suas versões anteriores, como por exemplo, o Redmi Buds 3 Pro. Eu já tive um desses, e em comparação com o Redmi Buds 5 Pro, é melhor! (Porém a diferença é pouca)
"

İlk defa mibuds kullanıyorum, ses tonu bası harika, her bir kulaklık 6-8 saat yüksek sesde kullanılır. Normal kullanımda haftada bir şarj etmeniz yeterli. Airbuds dan hiç eksigi yok bence
"

Kleine Kopfhörer mit starkem Sound und sehr stimmig verarbeitetem Design. Die Stöpsel passen sich dem Ohr gut an, deshalb flexibel einsetzbar.
"

After couple months and falls. It still stays good.. the sound quality is good and battery life is definitely amazing
"
"
Se ven genial pero no traen el cable de carga.
"
"
Great analog of apple. Sounds quality as always Great 👍🏻
"
"
Just what I ordered
"
"
Whoever packed this item to be delivered, put in two instruction booklets and no charger for the earbuds.  No other charger worked with this product.  It had to be returned.  Irresponsible packing and shipping.

Excelente

Los audífonos vienen sin cable para cargarlos, aunque en la publicación dice que si viene incluido. En cuestión de sonido se queda corto en potencia pero demás se escucha bien.
"
"
Muy bien
"
"
Los audífonos tienen buen sonido, no serán los mejores pero por su precio los considero que cumplen la verdad ninguna queja, sus materiales se notan que son económicos no hay mucho que decir. Lo que me sorprendió mucho fue su aislamiento de ruido, a pesar de que no cuentan con un sistema de aislamiento de ruido activo, los audífonos en si solo te aíslan muchísimo asi que por el precio que yo los agarre por 350 pesos, los recomiendo, lo único que no me gustó es su sistema de interacción para cambiar de canción y pausar, creo yo que eso es algo incómodo, al menos para mi pero recomiendo los audífonos
"
"
As mentioned on the product description section that it comes with type C charging cable but I have place the order two times for the same thing I didn’t got the cable inside the box. I don’t what’s going on here.
"
"
Boa qualidade preço / qualidade
"
"
Los compré por el hype pero realmente valen toda la pena, audio muy bueno y el Fastpair hacen que prácticamente en cuento abres los audífonos ya están conectados a tu celular
"
"
No es agradable confiarse en que en la descripción diga que incluye cable USB C y al abrir el producto no esté el cable en la caja, ahora tengo que comparle cable aparte.
"
"
I wanted an upgrade from a pair that I thought were pretty ""high tech"".  The Xiaomi Buds are excellent, the sound quality is off the charts, the noise cancellation is something that I didn't even know existed.  My favorite is the find feature, my old earbuds I lost all the time within my own bed.  Now I can push a button and locate them immediately.
"
"
Los he usado continuamente, funcionan apropiadamente. La duración de la batería de cada auricular está por debajo de lo indicado o especificado....no dura lo que dicen en la página de internet.
"
"
Buenos audífonos por el precio, la cancelación de ruido y el sonido están bien.Recomendables sobre todo si usas android ya que la aplicación no esta disponible en apple y no podrás sacarle todo el potencial

Rápido

it was a Xmas gift for my best friend. I bought the pro 3 version loved it. Especially the dual connectivity feature. I feel this product has great value! My friend is also very happy about it.
"
"
More comfortable and has better sound quality compared to the Redmi bud pro 3!
"
"
I'm extremely satisfied with this product. The sound quality is pretty amazing. The ANC on this product is really great for this price point and suitably competes with the ANC of more expensive products.
"
"
Purchased Nov 2022. It's July 2024 now and one of the earbuds stopped working a couple months ago.  Conveniently broke just after the 1 year warranty
"
"
Son muy buenos para el precio que tienen y dura mucho la batería los recomiendo la verdad tienen buena calidad de sonido solo le faltaría una mejor cancelación de ruido pero por todo lo demás está exelente.

Franchement top pour le prix et la qualité excellente : pas besoin de se ruiner :)

worth the money you pay, quick and easy connection to iPhone.

I had an amazing experience with these wireless earbuds. One of the standout features is that when you pull one earbud out, the music automatically pauses, and when you put it back in, it resumes. This is perfect for when someone asks you something mid-song—you can quickly respond and then get right back to your vibe.The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is also excellent. I used it on a plane, and it reduced the noise of the engines by about 90%, making them barely noticeable. Air fans completely disappeared. However, ANC also lowers the volume of everything around you, so when someone speaks to you, it's harder to hear them clearly, which often led me to remove the earbuds to understand them better.The Transparency mode wasn’t as impressive. It amplifies voices, but it doesn’t always focus on the person you want to hear, which can be frustrating.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase and the performance of these earbuds!

Sound Quality: Outstanding! These things blew away my old Apple earbuds, with deep lows and crackle-free highs. I've used Skullcandy and Apple, wired and wireless, and I've NEVER had sound this good and battery life this long. For the longest time I was forced to use an amplifier app in order to get my music to an acceptable volume, but I've finally been able to ditch it.Ease of Use: I honestly didn't even need the pamphlet that came with it, and haven't needed it. Just pull them out of the case and they immediately show up on the phone's Bluetooth connection for pairing. One click and they're off and running.Comfort: Fine for a few hours, but after that they DO become a little uncomfortable to wear; you don't really notice until you remove them, though.Stability: I must have weird ear canals, because I've never been able to keep silicone-tipped earbuds properly inserted, regardless of the size used. They ALL fall out with the smallest movement of my head. Even something as innocuous as a yawn or smile will pop them out and send them bouncing. Not these! They stay sitting just inside the ear and are firmly seated; I've even done yard work with them, without so much as a jiggle. Unaffected by sweat, but I wouldn't advise showering with them. Just in case.Appearance: Sleek, black design with a great LED indicator on the case showing charging and battery status. Has some heft to it, so it definitely doesn't feel cheap. The earbuds themselves are also pretty solid, BUT remember they are still delicate instruments; a short fall onto a hard, dense surface may well degrade their sound quality, or wreck the internal circuitry entirely. But the same can be said of $200+ earbuds.All in all, I couldn't be happier! If in the future these should turn out to live less than a year (barring unforseen accidents), I'll buy another set anyway. The quality is the best I've discovered at this unbeatable price point. 100% recommended!Note: I am NOT an audiophile, so if you're capable of hearing sounds that even dogs miss, I can't vouch for whether or not these are for you. But for the average, everyday ear...yes. Unequivocally.

These wireless Bluetooth earbuds are a game-changer for on-the-go listening! The sound quality is exceptional, with clear highs and deep bass that make any music or podcast enjoyable. The Bluetooth connection is stable and easy to pair with my devices, and I love the true wireless design for maximum freedom of movement. Battery life is impressive, lasting through multiple workouts and commutes on a single charge. They’re also comfortable to wear for extended periods, thanks to the ergonomic design. Overall, these earbuds offer great performance, convenience, and comfort—highly recommended!

I recently purchased the wireless earbuds, 5.3 Headphones .The delivery was fast and reliable. The sound quality is very good. The cost is very decent and the lifetime of the Battery is long approximately 8 hr for continuous song play. The earbud does not hurt my ear and is stable in my ear while working around. The sound control touch screen at the earbud tip is very good and sensitive for small touch. I like this feature, it is very convenient to receive call and play music or stop music as needed. The charging is easy and I can use my laptop to charge pod, and it last for almost week of charging earbuds.
"
"
I've been using these wireless earbuds for a few weeks now on my Peloton and I'm totally hooked. The sound is crisp and clear – perfect for my workouts. Plus, the battery life is insane! I can days without needing to charge the case. They're comfy too, and haven't fallen out once. Definitely worth the money!
"
"
Long battery life and decent sound quality. Negative is they do not fit firmly in your ear so they often fall out
"
"
I'm really impressed by these Wireless Earbuds! They fit perfectly in my ears and are way more comfortable and lightweight compared to others I’ve tried. The sound quality is excellent for music, podcasts, and calls.I didn't have any issues connecting Bluetooth, they automaticly paired. The touch controls make it easy to manage everything right on the earbuds without pulling out my phone. So far the battery life is excellent too. I like that they are waterproof, so when I wear them to the gym I don't have to worry or if I get caught in the rain! Overall, I highly recommend!
"
"
I use these daily for when I’m out in my garden to elevate my mood, and for calls (personal and work). They last me hours and are easy to navigate. They don’t fall out of my ear like others have and I’m bending down and back up a ton when gardening. The people on the other end of the call can hear me great. They sit comfortably in my ear, sound is awesome, and battery is decent. I’d order these again. I do wish the range went a little further but I just bring my phone with me outside when I’m gardening so I don’t lose range. I also love that they self recharge.
"
"
They are made of really good quality. They hold the charge for longer than I expected. The sound is very good quality. The fit was good, really good product for the price I would buy them again.
"
"
Love the compact design, lightweight feel in the ears and really long usage time. I use these all day when I'm at work, listening to music and taking calls and I've not had it run out of battery once yet.The earbuds are a really good design, not too big so they don't hurt your ears when using for prolonged periods, sound quality is really good, clear sound for music and calls, controls are very easy to use and connect really quickly, straight out of the box. Good price, good product. Highly recommended

Dopo aver utilizzato questi auricolari Bluetooth, sono rimasto colpito dalla loro qualità audio e dal comfort d’uso. La qualità del suono è buona sia per i bassi pieni che per gli alti. La connessione Bluetooth è veloce e costante, senza interruzioni anche durante le attività fisiche.Il design ergonomico permette di indossarli per ore senza alcun disagio, e la durata della batteria è sorprendente, richiedendo poche ricariche. L’isolamento acustico è molto buono, isolando efficacemente dai rumori esterni.Una caratteristica particolarmente apprezzata è il display integrato nel case, che mostra il livello di carica sia del case che degli auricolari.In conclusione, questi auricolari Bluetooth non sono solo un piacere per le orecchie ma anche un gioiello di tecnologia pratica e intuitiva. Li raccomando vivamente a chi cerca un prodotto di qualità con funzionalità intelligenti.

Habe die Kopfhörer für meine Arbeit gekauft und sie erfüllen voll ihren Zweck. Mittels USB C wird ein Akku innerhalb der Aufbewahrungsbox geladen, die Kopfhörer laden sich dann, wenn sie darin gelagert werden. Auch ohne angeschlossenem Kabel. Der Ton ist prima,  da gibt es nichts auszusetzen. Bluetooth war nach wenigen Sekunden eingerichtet. Super Preis Leistung Vergleich.

I recently purchased the Wireless Earbuds, and they have exceeded my expectations in every way! The Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity is seamless, providing a stable and strong connection with zero dropouts, even at a distance. The deep bass is fantastic, delivering rich and immersive sound quality that makes listening to music, podcasts, or any audio content an absolute pleasure.The noise-canceling feature is a game-changer, especially in noisy environments. With 4 ENC mics, these earbuds block out background noise effectively, allowing me to enjoy crystal-clear calls and audio without any interruptions. The mini design fits perfectly in my ears, offering comfort even during long wear, and they stay secure whether I'm at the gym or on a run.One of the standout features is the dual LED display on the case, which shows the battery life clearly. Speaking of battery life, these earbuds offer up to 30 hours of playtime, so I rarely need to recharge them. When I do, the USB-C charging is quick and convenient.Overall, these wireless earbuds are a fantastic investment. They combine cutting-edge technology, superb sound quality, and thoughtful design into one compact package. Highly recommended for anyone looking for top-notch wireless headphones in 2024!I recently purchased the Wireless Earbuds, and they have exceeded my expectations in every way!

Le cuffie esteticamente sono molto belle.Hanno una forma che permette di stare comode nelle orecchie. La durata della batteria è molto duratura.Con il Bluetooth non ci sono problemi.I rumori esterni, con le cuffie inserite, non si sentono perciò isolano perfettamente.Ottime per qualità prezzo

I don't go out of my way to leave a lot of reviews. But I figured I was so impressed with these that I would go ahead and leave a review. I purchased these a few days ago and I'm extremely pleased with the whole experience. Let me tell you the reasons why. I have something that you might describe as a shopping addiction lol. When I'm looking to purchase something, I will spend hours looking at every option before I finally pull the trigger. It was no different with this purchase. When going online and looking for earbuds that are less than $30, there are hundreds of choices. Most of them have great reviews and seem to be made pretty well. What sets these apart from the others are some pretty cool features.First, these will work with Siri through the earbud itself and not through the cell phone. Most inexpensive earbuds only work with Siri if you click it four times which is very difficult to do. These will work just like your airpods work. Which for me, is really cool since I used these for biking. I don't have to be clicking anything 4 times to skip songs or to play something different. And before anybody starts, I only put one in my right ear at a low level so I can hear traffic coming lol.They definitely hold the charge well. Which is good, because it's a pain in the neck for cheaper earbuds to have to be charging them every time you use them for a few hours. Also, the sound quality is absolutely amazing for the money. I have about four or five different sets of earbuds and one of them is an Apple Airpod. I don't know which generation. But I do know that these sound a little better than all of them. If you like deep bace and Crystal Clear sound, you'll love these. They have all that and more.They also have an app that you can use as an equalizer. You can use the 16 preset ones that are offered and they also post hundreds of other equalizer programs that you can try on your own. Of course you can also do your own custom equalizer . This is really cool for me since Apple Music does not offer an equalizer. Only the one on my IPhone 14+ and theirs is better.They will also do wireless charging, which I'm not sure if I'm happy about that or not since I don't ever use it. I guess I should try it. Pretty much most better phones all come with wireless charging these days. It seems to be the wave of the future. so I’ll go out and get a wireless charger after searching online for hours lol.The app that you have to download also has one button that you click to register for an 18-month warranty. Which is pretty cool since most sub $50 earbuds don't offer anything like this at all. From what I've read, their customer service is pretty decent, let's hope that's true.The case is also a little bit smaller than most of the others that I have. Which I like since I can fit them into my pocket easily. They also have the battery charged status on the cover. All my others do not have this. I have to guess whether they're going to last or not when I take them out for the day. So this feature I really like. I’ve used them for four or five hours at a time and not had any issues with the charge status going below 20%. They also come with six sets of very comfortable earbuds caps. I'm not sure of the cool name, but you get the idea.The earbuds connect effortlessly to my phone. I was happy with that since I have others that are real hassle to get them moving. A few of them, I have to open and close the case several times to get them to connect. Keep in mind this might be me because I’m kind of an idiot at times. But at least I’m honest lol. I've also gone into several different rooms 30 to 40 ft away and I didn't lose any connections. I have a few sets of earbuds that are always fading in or out if I sneeze the wrong way.A lot of these Amazon purchases that have glowing reviews are because the seller is somehow monetarily enticing people to leave a great review. I purchased these on my own at the full price and nobody is asking me to write anything lol. But since I was so impressed, I figured I would just fill you in on my thoughts.As far as longevity though, I don't really know. But I'm guessing they'll hold up pretty well. But in my mind, I can just buy another set if they become broken or lost and keep doing that for about 5 years before I get to the price of one set Apple Airpod lol. I can promise you that you will love these. Good luck and thank you for reading.

I picked these ear buds up based off of the raving reviews and I am not disappointed! These by far exceed my needs. I only use these to listen to music and for my workouts so I can't say how they are during phone calls. For music, they are great and sound a lot more expensive. They stay in my ears, and I have had no connection issues while I am active. I was surprised by how light they are so you don't really even notice them. One of my favorite features is the battery level displayed on the case when you open and close the lid. I can't tell you how many times I grab an older set I have, pop them in just to see the battery levels are low. I often don't even see the battery level until I run out the door and connect them to my phone. With these, I get a battery level reading at first glance. It even has wireless charging. The only downside with the wireless charging for me is I have a charging station that props your device up. and the case has the wireless charging connection on the bottom of the case. I have to set this case up facing on it's side which is not ideal. You can see in a picture I provided. This won't be an issue if you have a wireless charging pad. My other earbud case has wireless charging on the back side of the case so you can place it face up on a pad or facing out on the prop up charger. Either way it still works so I can't knock it too much. The noise cancelling is not active, so I feel these are not the best in that class. Overall, I highly recommend the Tozo T20 if you want earbuds that are affordable, sound amazing, have great battery, and are super comfortable!
"
"
I've been using these TOZO T20 for several weeks and I'm really enjoying them. Some of the reasons:--They connected easily to my phone and computer, as well as the TOZO app.--The charging case works great, and I love the LED power indicator. The case can be charged via USB or wirelessly. It’s also small and seems durable so far.--Battery life has been excellent.--They’re comfortable. And they stay securely in place, even during workouts.--The sound is quite good. Very clear and rich.--I’ve used them for both phone and video calls and have had no complaints– the dual mics with noise reduction perform admirably.--The TOZO app allows you to adjust EQ settings for different genres and listening situations. Very cool.--Lastly, you really can’t beat the price!I’d highly recommend them.

o fone é muito bom, a bateria durou pouco mais de 1 semana, e olhe que utilizo bastante.Às vezes ocorre algumas interferências ""tipo bugs"", não sei o motivo, mas o alcance dele é muito bom, uns 20 metros. Mas já ocorreram vezes de estar próximo ao meu dispositivo e estar falhando a conexão.o som do produto é muito bom, estou satisfeita.
"
"
Me baño con ellos y cero problemas tengo mas de 6 meses con ellos
"
"
Le uso quando suono la batteria, isolano bene il suono esterno e la qualità del suono è ottima con bassi ben definiti. Custodia robusta ed utilissima la visualizzazione della % di carica. Arrivano con 6 set di gommini dalla XXS all XXL ed un cavettino di ricarico molto corto poco ingombrante.
"
"
Son unos auriculares increíbles, un sonido magnífico con unos graves profundos, compatibles con la aplicación TOZO desde donde se pueden configurar y descargar actualizaciones.También son muy cómodos y con una duración de la batería muy extensa.Altamente recomendables
"
"
Der Sound ist klasse, sieht auch gut aus, mein Case hatte beim Aufladen immer bei 94 % aufgehört, habe mich an den Support Gewand aber geholfen hat er nun nicht wirklich , nachdem ich anderes Kabel benutzt hatte, funktionierte das aufladen zu 100%, das andere Kabel war aber nicht meins, sondern nur zum Testen, habe mir daraufhin eines gekauft, hätte mich auf eine kleine Gutschrift gefreut, aber nun ja, es ist wie es ist

My dog has a habit of destroying my earbuds.  I've been buying redmi for years due to their high quality for the price.  However these have been incredibly frustrating to use.  I've been through two sets and both of them have charging issues.  I'm not trying a third.  I will just move on to a different brand.  The issue seems to be the case.  It lights up when charging but often will stop charging almost immediately.  Even if the ear buds and case are dead as a doornail.  Also have had some connection issues but those are minor.  It really sucks to go use your earbuds after they were plugged in all night just to find out they are dead.
"

I had better ones, sound quality is on the average.

No

Lo recomiendo 100%

Si es muy bueno los audífonos son muy elegantes pero la cancelación de ruedo está más o menos pero depsues de eso está muy bien

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



I recently bought this because I used to have a pair of Redmi buds 3 lite and had a very good sound quality/price experience with them until one day, after a year of use, one of them stopped working properly (couldn't pair the left earbud even after several factory reset).Now, I decided to give it another try but the experience is worse. This time I couldn't even use them correctly for the first time.The left earbud's led light is only turned on when it is inside the case. When I take both earbuds out, only the right one (100% charged) blinks and is able to pair with my phone (Xiaomi Mi A3). Left earbud does not blinks, does not pairs. I've tried factory reset but it's only possible with the right one. I love Xiaomi but I'm very disappointed this time.Some of you may have the luck of buying and getting a non defective pair and have a great experience as I had at first. But I definitely do not recommend you to take the risk because it seems to be a common problem with this product.

O produto é conforme o anúncio, recomendo se suas características forem útil para vc, não é um produto TOP , basta ver o valor que será pago, mas vale muito a pena diante dos produtos piratas que tem no mercado, apesar de ter vindo da China parece original , o som é bom, a bateria não vou saber dizer da sua durabilidade, pois fiz a primeira carga e ainda estou usando, mas parece ser conforme o anúncio. Na verdade os produtos tem sua fabricação na China e ai eu nem saberia dizer a realidade, mas pela embalagem, rótulos, qualidade da caixinha de recarga, os materiais de produção do fone, enfim tudo é de excelente qualidade então se for pirata é produto de 1ª linha mesmo  !!!! Recomendo a compra !!!!

El sonido es bueno, es lo suficientemente fuerte y nítido para ir por la calle o en una oficina escuchando música sin problema.El auricular derecho tiene un panel táctil básico que funciona bien, aunque habría sido mejor con un gesto para retroceder la canción, sentí que le hizo falta.Son cómodos de usar por largos periodos sin problema, se sienten ligeros y el estuche es práctico de llevar.Se tardan aproximadamente 2 horas en cargar por completo y me duran alrededor de 3 o 4 días usándolos constantemente, con uso moderado pueden durar hasta 5 o 6 días.Para llamadas están bien, se escucha bien a la otra persona, aunque el micrófono pudo ser mejor, a veces era necesario que yo hablara un poco más fuerte para que se me entendiera, pero lo compensa que, al ser tan cómodos, puedes hablar por periodos largos sin sentir molestia.Por el precio están muy bien si quieres unos audífonos que sean económicos y con buen sonido (para el precio que tienen). Hay mejores, pero estos me parecen una buena opción y más si los ves en descuento.

Me gustaron mucho para el precio y las funciones.Dejo más detalle de mi experiencia, lo que me gustó y no me gustó:- La conexión es instantanea, basta sacarlos del estuche de carga y en unos dos segundos están conectados, el estuche cierra firme de forma magnética, los audífonos se sostienen y acomodan solos magnéticamente también dentro del estuche, al hacer esto se desconectarán, apagarán y cargarán.Recomiendo ampliamente limpiarlos después de cada uso antes de meterlos al estuche de carga.- Son pequeños pero muy cómodos. Pienso que la mayoría de las personas no tendrán ningún problema, en mi caso a la goma de afuera le falta ser un poco más grande ya que se me han salido un par de ocasiones pero nada serio.Probé las gomas internas tamaño grande pero noté que son mas suaves y sellan un poco menos que las medianas. Así que regresé a las medianas.Los he usado en bus por viajes largos y no me han cansado aunque la batería me ha durado entre 4 y 6 horas no me ha hecho falta más en uso continuo.- Los comandos táctiles podrían mejorar ya que Reproducir/Pausar requiere un toque largo y se me hace bastante largo. Cambiar de canción está bien que es con doble toque pero no hay forma de volver al inicio o a la pista anterior.Los tres toques llaman al asistente de voz y en mi opinión es algo completamente inútil pero algunas personas podrían encontrarle uso al pedir cambiar a otro tipo de música, subir o bajar volumen o algo diferente.-El modo de baja latencia es sorprendente.El retraso pasa de ser de algo cercano a 0.3 segundos a 0.1 segundo.- El volumen y calidad de sonido son buenos aunque tampoco es el mejor y solamente aceptan códec SBC y AAC que realmente son muy básicos. No tiene sentido usar con TIDAL Master u otra fuente de audio Hi-Res.En general aislan bien del ruido exterior y no se siente que hagan algún molesto vacío.- No cuentan con modo transparencia ni cancelación de ruido, cosa que cada vez es más común pero para alguien que sólo quiere música rs suficiente.- La calidad en llamadas es buena y podría decir que mejor que otros que he probado pero aún así no es sobresaliente.- Puedes usar sólo uno o ambos audifonos. No todos de otras marcas pueden hacer esto.- Han aguantado bien en el gimnasio y al correr, no he notado algún efecto negativo por el sudor pero yo siempre los limpió así que eso puede ayudar mucho.- Lo mejor de todo es la relación calidad/funciones/precio son altamente recomendables para quienes buscan algo funcional de bajo costo.(El costo de oferta en su momento fueron $369 mxn.)

The headphones came in excellent condition, plus delivery was really quick. One downside to this was could not download the app to sync with the headphones, which probably got blocked. Havent tried out the other app, but the reviews do not seem promising.

Un diseño elegante que me chulean cada vez que me los ven puestos y con una batería asombrosa como de 4-5 ciclos, aunque nunca me los he puesto a contar porque la batería de los audífonos en sí duran por horas.Además, cargan bien rápido. Puedo dejarlo 5 minutos y haber cargado casi toda. Ideal para las personas olvidadizas jaja (también tiene función de encontrarlos mediante sonido).Aunque hay ocasiones que se desconectan, pero probablemente sea mi dispositivo.Muy fáciles de usar y tiene gomitas para adaptarse al tamaño de tus oídos que incluso lo he usado para ir a correr.Tiene un sistema de cancelación de sonido bastante bueno.Sin duda, un increíble artículo para su precio (y mejor si lo agarras en oferta jaja)Llevo 5 meses con el artículo y siguen funcionando como nuevos.

Estoy muy satisfecho con la calidad precio de estos Redmi Buds 5.La calidad de sonido, claridad, volumen y la distancia de conexión (aún con obstáculos) son impresionantes!Además cuenta con su propia app para configurar diferentes gestos y perfiles que te permiten mejorar aún más el sonido y cancelar el ruido ambiente.Siento que he pagado el precio justo por un accesorio de muy alta calidad.

I love these earbuds, the noise cancellation is effective, the sound is great and the call quality is nice. I am glad I finally found the perfect earbuds for me. However, I've already misplaced my right earbud and I am so sad about that :( They work amazing with my Xiaomi phone and connect quickly. You can download the app for more features.

Estos auriculares inalámbricos pueden ser una excelente opción para aquellos que buscan un par de auriculares de calidad a un precio asequible. Con una calidad de sonido HD y una duración de batería de 18 horas, estos auriculares ofrecen una buena relación calidad-precio. Además, su resistencia al agua IPX4 los hace ideales para usar durante el ejercicio o en días lluviosos.Aunque no he podido probar su resistencia al agua personalmente, sí puedo decir que son cómodos de usar y fáciles de emparejar con otros dispositivos por Bluetooth. Además, tienen un botón de control que permite pausar la reproducción y cambiar de canción con facilidad. También me gusta mucho su diseño en color azul, que es atractivo y diferente.En general, si buscas unos auriculares inalámbricos a un precio asequible sin comprometer la calidad de sonido y la duración de batería, los Xiaomi Redmi Buds Essential pueden ser una buena opción. Su resistencia al agua y su facilidad de uso los convierten en una excelente alternativa para aquellos que buscan auriculares para el ejercicio o para los días lluviosos.

Sound Quality & PerformanceI've been thoroughly impressed with the sound quality of the CXK Neckband Bluetooth Headphones. The volume range is fantastic, and the deep, rich bass really enhanced my listening experience, whether I'm enjoying classical music or energizing dance tracks.Comfort & FitWith its ergonomic design, the headphones are incredibly comfortable, even during long sessions. I wore them while running on the treadmill and riding motorcycle, and they stayed securely in place without any discomfort.Battery LifeThe battery life is outstanding. I've used these headphones for 7 hours straight for 2 days now, and they’re still going strong. Knowing that I can rely on them for such extended periods without needing to recharge is a huge plus for my on-the-go lifestyle.Ease of Use & ControlsPairing these headphones is quick and hassle-free, thanks to the Bluetooth 5.3 technology. The controls are conveniently located on the right side of the neckband, making them easy to reach and operate. The controls for volume (+ and -) also work for going forward and backward when listening to an audiobook. I use Libby, and it worked perfectly.Voice Call QualityVoice calls are crystal clear with these headphones. I’ve had multiple conversations, and every time, the audio quality was great on both ends. The passive-noise reduction also does a good job of minimizing background noise, making calls more pleasant.Durability & WaterproofingThe IPX6 waterproof rating is reassuring, especially during workouts. I don't have to worry about sweat or a bit of rain damaging the headphones. The magnetic design is a thoughtful touch too, preventing tangles when not in use.Overall, my experience with these headphones has been extremely positive. They deliver on both sound quality and durability, making them an excellent choice for sports and everyday use. The affordable price compared to other high-quality headphones is a plus!This CXK Headphone is definitely a MUST-BUY!

The CXK Neckband Bluetooth Headphones are a fantastic choice for anyone looking for reliable, long-lasting wireless headphones.

The Bluetooth 5.3 ensures a solid and stable connection to your devices, making your listening experience smooth and hassle-free. Enjoy clear, rich sound with deep bass and crisp highs, perfect for any music genre. The neckband is lightweight and comfortable, making it easy to wear for hours without discomfort. The control buttons are simple to use, letting you adjust the volume, skip tracks, and take calls with ease.

Overall, the CXK Neckband Bluetooth Headphones are an excellent buy for anyone who loves listening to music on the go. Highly recommended!

The CXK Neckband Bluetooth headphones are an impressive pair of headphones. The volume range is one of the largest that I have seen in wireless headphones, and the sound quality is wonderful as well.The headphones come shipped in a nice box with different size earbuds and a USB-C charging cable. After a quick charge it is really easy to pair the headphones to your phone due to the advanced Bluetooth 5.3technology used.At first glace it does not look like these headphones would be comfortable but once you put them one you will be pleasantly surprised. The lightweight neckband is made of a soft skin-friendly silicone material and the special ear-wings are designed to keep the inserts in place while working out or doing things around the house.If you temporarily need to take the earpieces out for whatever reason you can connect them together with the build in magnets. In that way there is no way your headphones will slide from your neck.I used the CXK Neckband headphones to wash my truck on a hot day. Due to the IPX6 waterproof technology I was not concerned that the headphones would get damaged or break from sweating or water splashing on them.  The headphones stayed firmly in my ears and the neckband was not moving around causing any concerns either.Since then I have worn them for many hours around the house, to the office, and in the gym and I still have not had to recharge them.Conclusion: I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend these headphones. The sound quality is wonderful, the volume can be turned up really loud , the battery life is fantastic, and they are comfortable to wear. Having magnets in the earpieces is the icing on the cake.

I wasn't sure about the weird ear attachments, but they are actually very comfortable. These have a much better range than a more costly set of around-the-neck earbuds that I own, and they are simple to use and have a long battery life. The only reason I gave them 4 stars and not 5 is that the control buttons are not designed well - all three are flush with the unit, and it was very hard to tell which one I was pushing without looking down every time. So I added a very tiny drop of hot glue on the on/off button, which has made them easier to use. However, this is a design flaw resulting in the loss of a star.EDIT: I still like these a lot, but for some reason when doing phone calls, pressing the center button picks up a call, but does not end the call - maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I have to use the actual phone to hang up.

When I lost my airpods I bought these as a replacement until the new airpods with usb c were a thing. For the several months I used them, they were great for the sound quality/money and I'm leaving these at work whenever I forget to bring my airpods now.Obviously its not airpod quaity and you get what you pay for but I think in an emergency these serve well enough and the noise cancellation/transparency mode is fair

I bought these specifically for ANC. I have annoying neighbors around me and I work from home so I wanted noice cancelling headphones to block out the annoying sounds so I could focus on work. They exceeded my expectations in that area. I've bought several different kinds of ANC headphones in the same price range and the noise canceling on these is by far the best I've experienced so far.AUDIO quality: 3/5NOISE cancelling: 5/5COMFORT: 3/5Some issues I have with these are they frequently lose connection for a second while they reconnect when near devices on 2.4ghz wifi. Also, when you've got more than one device connected (example my PC and cellphone) it will disconnect me watching YouTube on my phone when I get an email on my PC, then it will switch back to my pbone and automatically play spotify instead of the youtube video I was watching.. super annoying.

First off…if you are expecting Airpods Pro quality of audio then you shouldn’t be browsing for earbuds less than 200$.But if you are looking to just spend about $120/150 (depending if you wait for a sale) on some great earbuds i think this is it!They are built in a really great material, connection is really nice and fast just as airpods and if you loose one of them is not gonna be around $350!They have everything for the day to day use of regular earbuds!

O fone em si é mto bom.Porem, o encaixe dele no ouvido é ruim.Ele fica meio frouxo e solto, da medo de cair e quebrar.Mas o resto é bem bom!
"
"
Me gusto mucho el sonido es calido (grave) pero muy bien en general y aunque no tienen muy alto volumen suenan muy bien, tengo de otras marcas y por el precio estan muy bien
"
"
No son los mejores cascos, ni los que mejor suenan ni los que tienen mejor batería, pero calidad precio si son los mejores en todos los aspectos, calidad de sonido, batería y materiales.Se conectan al dispositivo en cuanto abres la caja para sacar los auriculares, el sonido es nítido, no está saturado de graves que esto lo suelen hacer para tapar la (mala) calidad en auriculares de este segmento de precio.La batería dura unas 5 horas y se recarga rápidamente.Puedes usar solo uno si lo necesitas para trabajar y atender el móvil, se escucha muy bien la llamada y el micro es perfecto.Se me perdió uno y lo entonces rápidamente por el sistema que tiene para encontrar el auricular perdido, esto me encantó.Puntos negativos. En este segmento de precio sería absurdo poner un punto negativo porque calidad precio no se puede pedir más.Si quieres un sonido con gravee, o un sonido completamente nítido, cancelación de ruido, o una batería que dure mucho,.tienes que gastar más dinero

If i bought these earpods for 100 dollars, i would still be happy with the buy performance wise.They sound good, nice balanced sound, good bass, clear details on my phone with the bass turned a bit up on the phones EQ, im not a audiophile, but i do care about good sound, and these are good, unbelievable for like 20 dollars!With a bluetooth 5.0 adapter plugged in my PC i they sound very good too, i use the Peace Apo Equalizer to tweak and they sound better than my corded apple earpods.I get latency in games, even with the low latency mode these pods come with, its detectable in fps games, but i have ordered a bluetooth 5.3 to test out later in the week to see if it gets any better (these are BT 5.3 pods).In games i would guess i get something around 200 ms delay with the low latency mode ON that these pods comes with, in media like spotify, whatching JRE pod on video, i detect no delay with low latency mode on, games both on mobile and PC seems to make the delay worse than when you just watch movies.ONE more big thing, i was listening to spotify and jumped on discord on the PC, joined a channel, and suddenly all other sound but the discord audio chat was muted, appearantly BT cant handle theese dual channel sound thingys when you use the mic on the earpods, i guess this is a BT thing but i will test out the 5.3 adapter to see if that solves the problem as well.Short story: These earpods ar amazing, for 20 dollars they are a epic bargain, listening to music is a blast, talking on the phone works well, the mic is good, you can game on PC with these but with BT 5.0 you cant talk on discord and listen to spotify the same time, there is a slight delay also.Buy these if you need some new pods for your phone, ive had the jbl tws 2 pro for two years now and these are on par with those, other then that theese are PODS and they are PLUGS.I will post a update on BT 5.3 and see if the latency and the Discord issue will be solved.

I acquired my first set of these by happenstance…. My neighbor had gotten them for her boyfriend and they broke up before they arrived, so she asked if I wanted them. I figured I’d give them a try and said yes, and I’m very glad I did! I’m not an audiophile, nor do I have much of a budget, so I was rocking my three year old Jaybird Vistas still, which I loved for the sound quality, but after having completed my college degree primarily by Zoom during the pandemic, my ears were hurting after extended wear and I wasn’t sure where to go from there. These little earbuds surprised me with their high quality sound and how insanely comfortable they were in my ears. I don’t need a high level of sound dampening but they work great in the train tunnel during my commute, and I can still hear well enough when they’re in Transparency mode. Using the app is easy and personalizes the buds to my preferences, and they have a fantastic range which can handle the bass in dance, rock, and whatever else I’m listening to, even at higher volumes. Plus, when I receive calls, the other person can hear me clearly! I’ve never had them fall out of my ears except for when I’ve accidentally dislodged them by bumping them, but even then it’s a rare occurrence and they’ve never broken. (I’m only on a second set because my wife absconded with my first set and has refused to give them up, even over her AirPods Pro, so I figured I better order my own…. Happy wife, happy life, right?) The battery life is also  crazy in the best way…. I’ve only had to charge them a handful of times in almost a year, and I use them at least a couple of hours a day. In my opinion, you’ll really have a  time finding a better pair of earbuds for the money.
"

These are the best earbuds I've ever bought. Soundcore has definitely gained a customer after this. Audio is crisp and clean especially if the LDAC feature is activated. The bass is excellent. Everything is just so well balanced. I really love the app the soundcore app too. It makes everything easier as you can easily adjust everything to your liking from there. Connectivity is not a problem either. I can go quite a distance around the house without worrying about it being disconnected. Best of all is the battery life. The buds normally last me all day and the case lasts me all week before charging. All in all 10/10. It's worth every dime.

EDIT (July 30): Unfortunately, the same thing is still happening in phone calls: my voice stops coming through for the person on the other end of the line after 7-10 minutes and I need to switch my mic from my headphones to my phone and back to the headphones again. I do like the size and quality of these earbuds so I'm going to keep them, but I probably won't purchase again. Full review below!EDIT (July 18): The seller provided me with a prompt replacement pair at no cost, which was really nice. The audio quality of calls/recordings seems to be much improved, and I so far do not have the issues with calls disconnecting. I will continue to use these and will update again if the same issues arise—but so far, so good! Bumped my review up to a four-star.THINGS I LOVE:I'm impressed with the sound quality, noise cancellation, comfort, and customizable touch commands on these earbuds. Of course the sound quality won't match top-of-the-line over-ear headphones and you won't get studio sound, but these are pretty darn solid in terms of sound quality. Crisp and full. I use these on the subway and the noise-cancelling is enough that I can keep the volume at a comfortable level—rather than cranking the volume up like I did on my old AirPods. There are multiple noise-cancelling modes and you can even turn noise-cancelling off if it freaks you out. Overall, I'm very happy with how these sound.They also come with every size of ear tips so you can get a snug but comfy fit. The intuitive accompanying app is not necessary, but I used it to customize touch commands to raise/lower volume, skip ahead or back, and play/pause. Really simple to use, and easy to create gestures that make sense for your use case.Battery life is pretty amazing too. I got these a few weeks ago, charged up the case, and haven't had to charge it again yet. These aren't my main headphones, but I've used them almost every day for walks, errands, exercise, and commuting. Very impressive battery life so far.They've also been pretty tolerant of exercise sweat, though I will say that they were acting possessed for an hour after getting sweaty. These were more comfortable and sound-immersive than my old AirPods for workout music, but my AirPods held up better to sweat. These still win for me in that category, though, because of the ANC and the fact that they didn't fall out of my head and go flying off the treadmill belt underneath me.So mostly, I love these.THE MAJOR PROBLEM, THOUGH:Now, the flaw—which would be a dealbreaker if these weren't only $60 and such a dream otherwise—THESE ARE UNUSABLE FOR CALLS. I actually CANNOT use them for phone calls. The audio quality sounds ""underwater"" as my friends and family put it over the phone, and my audio quality tests yield the same results.Even worse, they randomly stop sending my audio signal every seven or eight minutes. So I'll pick up the phone while out for a walk, talk with poor audio quality for a few minutes, and then the person on the other end of the line suddenly does the whole ""Ohp, I think you cut out—you there? Hello? Can you hear me?"" And I need to switch my audio source to my phone, then back to the headphones. This happens every few minutes for the entire call. It's such a pain that I can't put myself or phone friends through it anymore. I don't even talk on the phone often, but this is a big enough problem that I might have to replace these.One of the reasons I bought these was to have reliable earbuds for work calls and phone calls, but these don't work for those scenarios. It's really too bad, because these are SO GREAT (especially for the price) otherwise.NOTE: See my updated edit at the top of this review.

Synopsis: Great set of earbuds with decent noise deafening, decent transparency, great sound, great size, awesome battery life, and good comfort!Sound: These earbuds sound very good! I'm not the audiophile I used to be, but they seemed to handle Rock, Folk/Indie, and Podcasts quite well! As far as noise canceling and transparency, they seem to work quite well! I often only wear one bud around the house or at work so I can hear someone if they walk up to me. They are the first set with NC/transparency and I really enjoy the transparency setting, not perfect, but quite impressive to me! Noise canceling has been nice when working on the car and running an impact wrench to deaden the sound some, but they are not silent by any means.Form factor: I love the size of the case, as my last set was the Spirit X2s, so these fit much more comfortablely in my pocket. They have quite a few ear tip sizes and between the comfort and the transparency, they are much easier to forget you are wearing than other buds I have owned. I am not really a fan of the touch button function, but it is generally functional and customizable in the app. It does become annoying when you want to push the bud in your ear, as it registers the touch as a button push.Overall, I am quite impressed with these, especially seeing as how they go on sale less than $50!

A qualidade deste fone é excelente. Testei ele na estrada e além do áudio fantástico, não conseguia ouvir praticamente nada do motor do carro e do barulho da rodovia. A interface do app para celular é muito boa e simples. Fácil de configurar e usar. A bateria tem durado muito. Fiquei mais de um mês sem carregar e a bateria do estojo sempre preenchia a bateria do fone para 100%. O preço não é dos mais favoráveis, mas a qualidade vale o preço sim. Ah, outra coisa importante: se você costuma jogar muito ou assistir a vídeos, este fone tem uma das menores taxa de lag do mercado. Além do modo jogo, que reduz o lag ainda mais, o modo normal já deixa o lag praticamente imperceptível. Esta foi a principal razão de eu ter comprado este fone, o atraso mínimo, que eu não consigo notar. E o isolamento de ruído dele ganhou excelentes avaliações como uma das melhores do mercado.

I'm writing this review while waiting for my second purchase of the Space A40. No, there wasn't anything wrong with the first purchase. Rather I was so satisfied with the first one - which has become my wife has commandeered - that I didn't have to reconsider getting a second one.I personally think five-star reviews should generally be taken with caution, but here I would like to qualify and detail why the Space A40 deserves five stars overall.First, I give the audio quality/noise cancellation four stars, compared to say, the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones (better sound, better noise cancelling) or Apple's AirPods Pro (2nd gen.) (less satisfying sound, better Transparency/Adaptive noise cancelling modes). The important things to keep in mind in these comparisons is that the Sony cost about three times as much, and generally full-sixed over-ear headphones sound better than earbuds. Plus, the XM4 was once Sony's flagship in the Bluetooth noise-cancelling headphones category, so it's more effective if you want to shut out the world, and envelop yourself in a rich, albeit a little bass-heavy audio environment. In comparison, the Space A40 gives you a balanced, quality sound and lets in a bit more of ambient sounds. As an analogy, the Sony XM4 is like using blackout curtains in a big auditorium, while using the A40 is like you're in a smaller venue with room-darkening curtains.Next, the AirPods Pro. Its strengths are that it works very well with iPhones, iPads, and Macs in general, and if you're an Apple Music subscriber like me, they work flawlessly with Apple's Spatial Audio. In terms of noise cancelling, Apple's very good Transparency mode is now superseded by its new Adaptive mode, which actively moderates the sound environment such that you can hear both music and ambient sounds well enough. But note ""enough."" This phrase pretty much sums up the audio performance and noise cancelling abilities of the AirPods. They give you good enough sound but the Space A40 is more subtle, balanced, and present; no point comparing the AirPods to the Sonys. The AirPods cancel noise just about as good as the Space A40; again, don't compare it to the Sonys. Oh, but the price tag! if you take price into the comparison, then the AirPods would drop out of the race immediately. It is obscenely overpriced. The only reason why I even own the AirPods Pro is that they were free gifts as part of another purchase. Going back to the curtains analogy: the AirPods are super futuristic - and expensive - curtains that automatically filter light going into a small venue but cannot fully darken the room. You pay for the look and the automatic filtering feature.So where does that leave the Space A40? An eminently sensible choice when you consider everything else. The Soundcore app is very polished and feature-laden and allows you to customize the use and the sound of the A40 to a very large extent, surpassing both Sony and Apple. Add to that the A40's battery life, a very pocketable case that charges wirelessly as well as via cable with clear indicator lights, and the overall good construction, you'd wonder why anyone would bother looking at anything else.Hence, a solid five stars.

Léger, qualité sonore très bonne, bonne autonomie. Pas le mieux au niveau tenu dans l oreille pour faire un footing (comme tous ces types d écouteurs intra auriculaire) sinon rien à dire.

I've had a few pairs of ear buds in the past, and I honestly like these the best. They pair instantly to my android phone, have great sound quality, and last a long time. The charging case with the percentage number is a nice feature.I'm a little confused on where the touch buttons are as they're sensors, but other than that, they are great. They do hang out of your ear rather than go directly in like other buds.

These earbuds are great! Paired easily with my iPhone, sound is good, battery life is good, and the price is unbeatable. I am less stressful about losing them as they are affordable to replace. I also like the battery percentage LED reading on the case.

I use this product for work on my iPhone. Not only does it meet my needs and provide a long last battery, but it fits well in my ear. The case is and earbuds are durable too. Connectivity and pairing was very easy. I highly recommend it for personal and business use. Lucid sound and budget friendly.

So far these ear buds work and sound very good. They are fairly comfortable and seem like they are just a durable as I buds.The sound is not the same but either is the price. They are very good for the price.

We have bought a total of 3 pairs of these ear buds for myself and my teens over the last year. They work great! They have great sound quality and easy to set up. I am a maintenance man so I am in all kinds of weather and these ear buds work great and are very durable! I love that it has a digital battery charger on the front so I always know where I stand with them.

I recently purchased these wireless earphones, and they have exceeded all my expectations. The sound quality is top-notch with crisp highs and deep bass, making every song a treat. They're super comfortable, even for long periods, and the sleek design is a bonus.Battery life is impressive—I can go all day without recharging, and the fast charging is a great feature. Pairing was simple, and the connection is always stable, even when I move around the house.For the price, these earphones are an absolute steal. Highly recommend!

These last for days… I honestly charge them every 4 days…easy to pair, amazing price, charges pretty fast cheaper then apple air pods… it shows you the percentage, also once you open the ear pieces from the pod it says pairing and connects just need to have blue tooth on…

I bought these ear buds and I love them. They sound great and I can’t beat the price. If you want a pair of ear buds that does the job without spending 300 bucks, I recommend these.

I was impressed right away by the high frequency sound from this headset, rivaling my earbuds, the bass was also very good, the best I have heard from a bone conduction headset.  The controls were simple to remember and operated easily, I very quickly got so used to their feel and position that I was using them with hardly even thinking about it.  The fit was acceptable, I wear glasses with titanium bow pieces and the headset was comfortable around my ears even with my glasses on (I think it might be more of a problem for those who have thicker plastic bows). They are just a hair tighter on the neckband than my other bone conduction headset, still comfortable, but noticeable when I look up high. I am an inch or two over 6 foot tall and wear a size 18 shirt, a person any bigger than me might not like the fit of this headset.  The battery life was great, I wore them all day long on a testing day using them for music and phone calls actively almost all the time and did not run out of battery. I am sure I got my 10 hours of actual use and more from the battery charge. The headset dropped connection and would not reconnect shortly after it said 10% charge, There was no audible low battery warning, I lost my connection a little premature to that point or there is no audible function like many of my other Bluetooth audio devices.  The MP3 mode for stored audio files to the headset is great for activities where you are unable to carry your phone with you, for myself I will normally use the headset streaming music and calls from the phone. I do like the feature, but will only make use of it on occasion.  The headset was decent for me to use while mowing. A pair of silicone earplugs to detune the mower noise and I was able to hear music and audiobooks fairly easily over the mower noise (my mower does make a little less noise than many).Overall I am very satisfied with the quality of audio, the construction is very good. The operation is better than average and the fit/comfort is very good outside perhaps those who fit the notations earlier. I rate this headset to be on par with the majority of top-level bone conduction headsets available at the time of this writing.

I've fallen in love with these headphones. They've seamlessly integrated into my everyday routine, so much so that their presence often escapes my notice. The design is not only sleek but also secure, ensuring they stay in place throughout my activities. The control buttons are intuitively placed, making it a breeze to switch tracks, adjust the volume, and even access the internal MP3 player.The Bluetooth coverage is impressively extensive. While these headphones don't offer active noise cancellation, they're designed to keep you connected to your surroundings, a feature that's essential for safety, particularly for women who need to be aware of their environment.I wholeheartedly recommend these headphones to anyone who prioritizes comfort, functionality, and the ability to maintain situational awareness in a bustling world.

As someone who uses noise cancelling headphones, I was very skeptical about these headphones and if they would actually suit my needs. These headphones work great for yard work and any outdoor needs.A few talking points about these headphones.Sound Quality: I was not expecting audiophile levels of base and quality from these headphones. You will not get that with these. If you are looking for noise cancellation these headphone do not have that feature so do not purchase these if that is something you cannot do without. I will say that these headphones are good enough to have some tunes to jam out to while doing yard work or anything where awareness of your surroundings are needed. The volume of these headphones worked fine for my needs and did not need to be adjusted past safe levels unless I was in a very noisy environment. These headphones will also work in situations where you need to hear whats going on around you if you are out for a jog or walking. There is no way to adjust any sound options like an equalizer and frankly they don't need one. I was quite satisfied with the audio quality from these headphones. The buttons used to power on the device andComfort and fit:When first trying these on They are very lightweight and comfortable as advertised. No pressure on my ears or the side of my head. My only complaint is that when you look upwards and side to side they seem to be a little small for my head. My Fiance on the other hand does not have this issue. (I guess I just have a big head haha) But when I was engaged in activities that required me to face forward or do limited head movements these worked great. I would only suggest the manufacturer think about different sizes of bands or make them somewhat adjustable. The way these headbands are made do not adjust in size but will adequately accommodate hair and Reading Glasses/Sunglasses with no issue.Bluetooth connectivity: I had no issue with this device staying connected to my phone. Many other headphones that I have bought specifically for outdoor use tend to lose connection when my phone is in my back pocket or when I turn my head a certain angle. I had no issues with that at all.Water Resistance: I did not drop these in water or do anything crazy to test this feature but I can say that I sweat a great deal when I am doing things outdoors. This pair of headphones had no problems from getting drenched in sweat.Charging Cable: The provided charging cable was very long and I didn't expect to get one like this. Many devices now only come with tiny charging cables. The cable can be used with any adaptive charging block and they magnetically connect to the headphones with little issue.I cannot speak for the on board storage because I typically use spotify or another music streaming service.Still I would suggest anyone looking for a good set of headphones for yard work and outdoor exercise to give these a shot.
