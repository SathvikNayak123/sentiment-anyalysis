Review
"Pros:
- Pairs and switches well with multiple devices (my Android and my PC)
- Decent sound
- Decently comfortable (and I'm REALLY picky)

Cons:
- Battery life of the earbuds is just ok
- No ANC (which would be a miracle at this price)"
"Sound quality is okay for this price. They are very light, comfortable and small. Minus one star because they do not control volume level and app is not available when I scan barcode."
"Honestamente, el sonido que emite el audífono es nítido, el confort del audífono en el oído muy suave en mi primera impresión y en efecto la calidad parecen de mentira, no pesan nada, son muy ligeros y el emparejamiento a mi teléfono Samsung S20 FE podría calificarlo como DEMASIADO bueno, solo abrí la tapita del case y se emparejaron SUPER rápido como que si mi teléfono fuese Redmi, insano."
"Easy to operate, good product quality, very satisfied."
I was hoping for it to blow my head off but its still attached. Its pretty quiet but even when on the road its still enjoyable. It lets you hear what is going on outside. So it has no noice cancellation and its as if noise transparency is on at all times. I was hoping for an app to tune these buds like other headphones but it doesnt. But still good just a bit too quiet. Btw it works alot for calls and im super quiet when on the phone i pretty much whisper and people still hear me no matter what.
"Despite not being Apple airpods, these earbuds do the trick. They are very responsive and have strong battery life. I can tap the earbud and it instantly works and responds to my phone apps.
If you want to save some money on Apple airpods, this product is a cheap, efficient, alternative.
Something to note; the case is wireless charging and uses USB-C connection to charge the case.
Overall, a steal in price comparied to how expensive other earbuds are listed on the internet."
Overall had these for about a month. So far so good. Sound quality is good but not too much bass. For the price I think these are great. Been using them for my outdoor walks and have only charged them once so far. They seem to fit well even while moving around. Highly recommend for the price.
"Me encantaron, aunque tenen varios puntos negativos, el volumen es algo bajo, la calidad es decente para su precio (osea no es la mejor precisamente), los botones tactiles casi no me funcionan nose porqué, sin embargo la bateria les dura mucho, pero de verdad me dejan asombrado, tengo unos semi in hear que uso para el dia a dia que son superiores a estos en todo lo anterior menos en la duracion de bateria y cuestan el doble, estos los compré para el gym, estan geniales para lo poco que cuestan."
"Buenos audífonos inalámbricos ideales para ovaciones casuales. Un gran punto es su material ya que se siente muy satisfactorio. El sonido es bueno pero no lo mejor del mercado por eso no le doy 5 estrellas, pero sin duda un gran compra"
Good quality for this price
"Excelente carga, perfecto para viajes largos. El sonido es suficientemente bueno, no es profesional, pero si lo que se quiere es tener tu música por mucho tiempo está genial. Aunque no lo utilizo para llamadas, las pocas que he hecho usando los Redmi Buds 4 Active han sido sin problemas para escuchar o para que me escuchen a mí."
"El sonido es pobre, lo único que sobresale es la duración de la batería.
La comodidad es regular una hora con ellos y ya dolía un poco en oído."
Me agradó su comodidad y sonido
Funcionan bien
"Me gustaron mucho, les dura mucho la carga de batería y con un buen sonido."
Su batería dura lo que debería
"Mi primera impresión fue que son bastante livianos. Pensé que eran de mentira jajaja

Luego que empecé a usarlos me encantaron. Los recomiendo. Los puse a cargar tan pronto llegaron a mis manos y llevo una semana usándolos desde que los compré y aún no los he puesto a cargar, la batería ha durado demasiado y yo los uso todos los días, eso sí, en mi ritmo de trabajo solo uso un bus a la vez todos los días.

El sonido es excelente, fácil de usar."
Los materiales son muy buenos y el sonido excelente por el precio se recomienda totalmente
ok
"Tiene buen sonido buen bajo aunque el sonido es un poco bajo, les doy un 9"
"Excelente como todo lo de Xiaomi
Conexión inmediata"
I love the sleek look of the earbuds but the only downside is this product doesn't come with any type of charging cord. Luckily I'd purchased a cord for another device and it fit perfectly.
Got this on sale for like 16 dollars. Can't beat that price and was pretty good quality. Sound isn't great but works.
Buenas cancelación pasiva de ruido
"Suenan bien, son comodos pero la bateria no dura mucho. Buena calidad por el precio que se esta pagando."
I'm very happy with my purchase.
"Buen sonido, buena duración de batería y sus controles con los toques lo hacen perfectos"
Se escucha nítido
muy bueno el precio...
Muy buenos x lo q pagas
"llegaron segun lo solicitado, buen producto , faciles de configurar."
"These are easy to sync up compared to some others. For an inexpensive, easy to use ear buds I really recommend these little guys"
These are proof of you get what you pay for. They have NO noise canceling.
"Buenas compra
Exelente!!"
"No tienen un volumen tan alto, ni bajos pero son aceptables por el precio pagado"
"Value for money is okay, not so great but at least it makes the job. I don’t like it doesn’t last much (battery) also they don’t come with the cable or charger. It’s very confusing to do the commands."
look good at this price
"Nice headphones good price , not feel the sound is outstanding but battery is awesome , nice product at nest price

Noise suppression is really good"
I'm coming down from Airpods gotta say this thing surprised me for the price i wasn't expecting this quality music sounds great of you do make calls it's okay thou.
"No me gustó mucho, espere más del producto, tiene bajo sonido"
"Aisla el ruido, buen producto"
ESTAN BIEN PARA EL COSTO
"Muy buena duración de batería, buenas calidad de audio, aunque un poco bajo el volumen"
Muy buena calidad
"If you’re looking for a cheap earbud, that’s a good call. I needed it asap and didn’t want to invest money in a expensive one.
Got what I paid for. Simple"
Muy buenos
"Cuando están al alcance, es perfecto, sin embargo, al llevar mi teléfono (o cualquier dispositivo) en mi bolsillo, y estar conectado a mis audífonos, no se puede escuchar nada de la manera fluida que se espera (señal altamente interrumpida)"
Excelente calidad de sonido y cómodos!
Todo muy bueno
Great earbuds for the price. Audio quality is really great. Great battery life so far. The Redmond connectivity was rather simple and easy to my iPhone. Noise cancellation is good as well not AirPod Pro quality standards but for $16/17 these are great. Would recommend
"It's easy to use, very nice quality, and very comfortable."
"Let’s start talking about the battery, it doesn't last long. If you're on a call, you have to switch sides or you'll soon run out of battery.
Another negative point is the sound. super low. If you are on the street you can't hear well what the other person is saying.
And finally, the app they suggest downloading to control the buds doesn't open in the USA. I can't know how much battery it has or anything about it.
Maybe I'll try another model from this brand. But I don't recommend this one."
"Los audífonos suenan bastante bien, y además estaban a muy buen precio ($16.99). Totalmente recomendados. Valen la pena."
LO RECOMIENDO
tiene 2 segundos de atraso para los jugadores en lunes. Son muy cómodos tiene buena bateria
Fue un regalo para mí mamá y le encantaron. Llegó rápido y en excelente condiciones.
Buenisimos para su precio excelentes calidad
Excelente producto buen sonido.
"Excellent value, and the sound was awesome for that price."
"Not bad, feels comfortable and sounds is pretty good. Could have more bass
But for 16$ can't ask for more."
Got these on sale and honestly there’s nothing more i could ask at this price. It excels at basic task. Connectivity is good. Redmi Application is fast and fluid. Sound is awesome. Base is good. Using with iphone. No problems at all. 5 stars.
"Recibí antes de la fecha y el producto llegó en perfectas condiciones. Fácil de usar, lo que más me gusta es que tienen cancelación de sonido y un buen micrófono. Completamente satisfecha con mi compra!"
No trae cargador! Eso me parece super incomodo la verdad.
"They fall out of my ear, randomly cut off and don't last 10 hours of my 12 hour work shift. I push one back into my ear and it's so sensitive that it either hangs up the phone or cuts my music off. I would also have preferred ones that have a digital charging screen to let me know that they are charging. I don't think this item has a 'charging case'. I feel like the earbuds aren't charging unless they are plugged into a usb-c cord."
Muy buen sonido y aislamiento en relación al precio
"Llevo 3 semanas usandolos. El micrófono funciona mejor de lo esperado, percibo calidad, la carga de batería dura, el audio es aceptable. El vendedor es cuidadoso con la cajas, llegaron impecables."
"Greatly exceeded my expectations for form factor, ease of pairing, design, ergonomics, case, and comfort while wearing. I didn't realize the case has a battery, LED, and magnetic snaps. I've tried all three rubber ear adapters, but even the largest falls out of my ear during exercise. Music from mp3s sounded tinny even after trying EQ adjustment. Very cool, but the two problems (fit and sound quality) are deal breakers."
Great sound quality and easy connection. There is an app available but it's not necessary. They fit great and come with many different size tips. Highly recommend!
"El sonido, no es tan bueno. Le dura bastante la batería, son impermeables"
"Perfectos, livianos y no se caen"
Lo mejores sin duda
Para el precio esta muy bien
Perfecto
Very low sound even when volume is all the way up.
It didn't come with a charger not sure if that's normal but was very disappointed about that
The right of the earbuds died only 3 hours after fully charged. No signals to show the battery volume.
"Estos audífonos Redmi buds 4 Active son de mala calidad, no ajustan bien y el sonido es malo. He comprado anteriormente unos bud 4 Lite y se escucha mejor siendo más baratos. Aconsejo no comprarlos porque por menos dinero se compra algo de mejor calidad."
The battery on these last about 2 hours max. They make wild claims about battery life and it is not true in any way whatsoever.
"TL;DR: DON'T BUY, YOU'RE WELCOME. I bought these because of the low price and Xiaomi brand as I have a lot of products from them, including Redmi phones and the other wireless ear pods that look a bit like Apple ones. Hoped these will be same or at least not worse, but frankly they are rather horrible. Falling out of the ear, sound quality is mediocre, there are intermittent disconnects, basically I didn't even bother returning them, as too much trouble. What a write-off of $30 AUD."
first test and it failed miserably. People can't hear my voice if TV was on or if there was people talking near me. The caller will hear the background noise more than my own voice. Just go with a different brand.
"Estos audífonos no sirven su propósito en lo absoluto. Siempre se están cayendo, he probado con todos cauchos que trae la con ninguno logran ajustarse al oído. Pésimo producto. Absolutamente decepcionado. No los recomiendo para nada."
The product came without it charger. So disappointed
Suenan muy suave entonces no se alcanza a saber la calidad de los audífonos
Very cheap. But quality is also very low. Feels very low quality. Absolutely no bass. Can’t connect to 2 devices at the same time. Have to disconnect one and then connect other.
Wasn't loud enough
Zero stars
"These only supports sbc codec. I first tried this with a bluetooth transmitter that supports bluetooth 5.3. You have to manually enable the low latency mode with the touch controls, but it seems to work with this adapter.

== Android ==

Android experience seems alright. Connecting is quick. You get a notification with battery status for each bud (this battery status also shows up when paired to other devices). Touch controls are basic: track control, and pause. I'm only on bluetooth 5.1 here so I don't think I'm getting the low latency feature here even when I enable it.

Android offered to set up 'Find My Device'. There is also the ability to ring the earbud if you lose it without enabling that. Sound is not very loud, but still would be helpful locating a misplaced bud.

There is a QR code to download a Xiaomi app. It takes me to their site which redirects to a US subdomain, and then to the play store app, but the play store says ""This item isn't available in your country"". So much for firmware updates or toggling features from the phone I guess.

== Physical ==

These have oblong silicone earbud tips. The medium looked closer to normal small size, but I still had to switch to the small for a good fit (I normally use the small size). Fit is comfortable. They are light and pretty unobtrusive. I found the light weight with the oblong tip does a good job keeping the earbud in place even though they lack positive retention.

The charging case with buds weighs about 41.5g. The pair of buds is only 7.6g.

== Usage ==

Instructions are a bit too Ikea, and then the text explanations that do exist are on different pages than the picture instructions so it is difficult to decipher them.

Low latency mode has to be manually enabled by holding both bud's touch buttons for 1.5 seconds. A 3-tone chime plays. You can't turn it back off without putting them back in the case.

The buds seems to handle switching devices OK. I can disconnect on my phone, turn my transmitter on, and they pair to it. To get them back on the phone I have to manually connect again though. I didn't find any automatic method so I don't have to interact with the currently paired device though.

They are not the best at blocking external sounds out, but this is probably desirable in an active bud where you want to hear your surroundings."
"The overall design is simple. The matte black case fends off smudges well and so do the stem buds. In the hands, both the case and the buds feel very light and somewhat cheap. But that’s not such a bad thing as the weight allows the buds to not be felt in the ear after a little while. When listening on the couch or relaxing, they are great. However, in my experience, the oval shape of the buds makes them slippery with a bit of sweat when doing light housework or walking, and I had to constantly adjust them, which is very distracting. I worry they might fall off when running or doing dynamic exercise. By the way, training or heavy sweat is not a problem due to the IPX4 rating.

The buds paired easily with my Android phone using the fast pair feature. Bluetooth 5.3 allowed the buds to stay connected at decent distances without hiccups. The touch controls worked well for the most part, but I am disappointed that there seems to be no volume option. The 5-hour battery life is pretty good for a day’s on-off regular use, but for those extended listening sessions, the quick charge feature adds over 1.5 hours in just 10 minutes of charging. The case adds up to 28 hours. There is no wireless charging option and there is no USB-C cord included.

Although there is no active noise cancellation, by choosing the proper included tips, a good amount of noise is blocked and not a problem when playing. The call quality is more than decent, as I heard clearly, and even the wind was barely an issue. The app is minimal but adds a bit more customization. Sadly, there is no touch control customization or EQ. The low latency mode allowed lag or sync to be almost unnoticeable.

The 12mm drivers deliver a sound signature that actually surprised me. The bass has some kick without being too boomy and adds a warm tone to the sound signature. The midrange is present, and the treble is a bit recessed but still bright enough to add some clarity. I must stress that the sound quality heavily depends on the right ear tips.

These buds are as basic as they come. However, one must consider that they are a budget item. If it wasn’t for the fitting issue (it could be different for others), these would be my daily drivers when working out. I still say that they are inexpensive enough to have as a spare or for the kids."
"I received the Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 for review several weeks ago and have put them through some good testing in different settings - indoors, outdoors, quiet, and loud environments - and I was very surprised at the quality of their sound, connection, and fit for the price. I was able to take advantage of the fast pair option because I have an Android device - it worked well even after un-pairing them. I can attest that they are IPX4 rated because they are still working even after using them when I was sweating buckets during an outdoor activity.

The only reason I can't rate them a 5-star is due to a couple of shortcomings: 1) While they produce decent sound, they aren't the best; and 2) Perhaps the sound might be better if I could download the proprietary app to customize the proper settings (not available in the US). Overall, not a bad option if you're looking for affordable wireless ear buds."
"These Redmi Buds 4 Active ear buds from Xiaomi are a very nice budget-friendly option. These are not going to compete at the multi-hundred dollar level of some other brands but at this low a price they are exceptionally capable. The ear buds are very lightweight making them comfortable to wear.

The ear buds have good battery life; Xiaomi seems uncertain how much battery life as they state up to 28 hours in some places and then up to 30 in others. Also, the battery life has a little asterisk next to it in the listing with no definition as to why it is there. What they really should be saying to clarify the battery life is that the ear buds have a battery life around five hours but then the case can charge the ear buds multiple times leading to the total life of 28 (or 30?) hours.

The ear buds are listed as IPX4 with one image going so far as to state ""...hitting the gym and breaking a sweat"" but there is one of those pesky asterisks again. The asterisk is of course not detailed in the product listing but in checking with Xiaomi that asterisk translates to ""Please try to avoid using your earbuds during strenuous exercise, sweat during exercise may cause damage to the device"". Those two quoted statements seem to contradict each other.

There is also basic touch control built into the ear buds which is again nice at the price point. They also feature basic noise cancellation which works reasonably well.

Even with all the marketing asterisks, these are a quality set of ear buds when you consider how inexpensive they are."
"I was surprised to find Xiaomi products available in the US. This is a very well known brand abroad, but almost unknown here.
About the features and performance: Balanced sound profile, just a bit biased towards bass, light, perfect fit and affordable. It has ENC which helps with voice clarity for people on the other side of a call. Fast pair which is usually only found in way more expensive earbuds. And there is an almost useless phone app.
Negative points: The product description is very deceiving, since it advertises 'noise cancellation' without spelling out it is ENC (environment noise cancellation) and not ANC (ambient noise cancellation). One might skim through the text and believe they are ordering earbuds with ANC. I really do not like when manufacturers do that. And I really missed the ability to pair/connect to two devices, which is now table stakes at this price point."
"I got these for everyday listening, specifically for their sound-blocking due to using silicone inserts. They take a little positioning to get a good seal, then they sound good and block sound well. For the cost these are good.

Earbuds are build decently. They require some working in each time to get a good seal.

Sound quality is good. When seated properly bass goes down to 10Hz, but if they aren't fully in bass is poor. Highs sound a little muffled, but nothing major.

Touch controls are basic, just play/pause, next track, and call answer/hangup. They do support low-latency (long-touch both sides). No way turn on/off without the case, as is common these days.

App isn't available in the USA. I manually downloaded and installed the app and selected a different region. It doesn't offer any special features, other than firmware updates (none was available)."
"I use this as a backup pair of buds for when I occasionally misplace my primaries. These do a passable job at voice calls, just a bit tinny. Music, not so much. Will likely replace these with something < $50 but higher quality."
"At $18, these are... fine. The sound quality is mediocre, there is no noise cancelling, the charge lasts a decent while, they fit ok. On the down side, they feel cheap but that can be good in that they're light weight. The case is small and easy to pocket. Overall, they're exactly what I would expect for the price."
I was surprised that these sound so well. They are of course lacking in bass but music and voice are crystal clear. No issues connecting to my S21+ phone. Battery lasts 8 or more hours pending on the volume setting. I can recommend these for a low cost set.
"At this price they are pretty much disposable and I’m fine letting my kids use these at the risk of being lost. However the sound quality is decent enough that I’d use them for casual use cases. They’re ok to wear, not uncomfortable but not something I’d probably want all day either.

The buttons work to play and pause but when trying to force into pairing mode to connect with a new device I can’t get them to do it. The instructions say to touch both ear buds 3 times at the same time but it doesn’t seem to work. To pair to a new device I had to walk out into the yard to get away from the other device, turn them on, and pair with the new one. It’s annoying but I don’t need to change them that frequently."
"Using these with a Pixel 7, the one touch connect was straight forward. Go to your bluetooth settings and after you open the buds they try to connect with your phone (it's usually the other way around where you have to choose the device), just press connect and go (albeit connecting any bluetooth headphones is easy also). The nice part is shows the battery status when you look at your bluetooth devices. My other headphones would just die without notice, so it's nice knowing when I need to charge. The sound quality at this price point is really amazing! Boomy bass and crisp highs, the caveat being you have to choose the correct tips. I tried them first with the tips that came on default and I thought the sound was very lacking. I have another set of similar style buds that I really like, so I was comparing these Xiaomi's to those to figure out if the Xiaomi's were any good. I didn't think it was close at first, with my older one's being way better, but then just for kicks I swapped bud tips and it made a big difference! My older ones no longer sounded good, and the Xiaomi's sounded great! There is not a big selection of tips included (2 other sizes), but luckily one of the included sizes worked or I would've have to kept the bud tips swapped with my older set. These are my new favorite cheap wireless headphones! I don't know about 30 hrs of battery life, but I got a solid 8 hrs of constant play from 100% and ended on 20% battery left. The noise cancelling on a phone call is decent, but it all hinges on having the right size bud tips on. The touch controls work but I have never gotten a pair wireless buds with touch to work properly, these are no exception. You have to know the correct number of ""taps"" to do a function. Not worth being a selling point. Overall, these are easy recommend for what they are, a good pair of low cost wireless headphones!"
"I was wanting to be wowed by the Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 Active. The price is fantastic, and I thought they might be a worthy budget alternative to Airpods and other high end wireless earbuds. While the connectivity is great and the feature set is impressive with the Redmi Buds 4, they are sonically underwhelming. So while they are a nice pair of earbuds at a great price, you won't mistake them for Airpods or Bose Quiet Comfort earbuds or Beats or any other premium earbud.
The first thing you'll notice when unboxing these is the case. It is a sleek little black rounded square. A bit light and a little slick but sharp looking design-wise. The charging port is at the bottom with an unobtrusive LED next to it.
Connectivity is great. The Redmi Buds easily paired to my Android phone and connect right away every time, even with the phone locked or charging. Xiaomi has an app for these, but if you try to get it through the Play Store, it isn't available in the US. I imagine the same is true for iOS. I downloaded and installed the APK and had to tell the app I was from Canada. But I found that the Xiaomi Earbuds app was mostly unnecessary. There's not much the app can do that is not available in the basic Android settings. Xiaomi says you need the app for firmware updates, and you can turn on low-latency mode for gaming through the app. Battery status and find device are available through Android settings without using the app.
Now let's get down to brass tacks and talk about sound. I'm a bit of an audiophile and like my music loud and clear. I found the Redmi Buds to be underwhelming in the audio department. Vocal clarity is great, and they work well for voice calls. They are also great for anything with speech - videos, movies, TV or what have you. For music, I found the bass response to be poor overall. The volume is also too low for me. I like to crank my audio gear to 11 (at least some of the time), and these don't crank. Turned all the way up, the Redmi Buds won't blow you away. You won't feel like you're at the concert. I would imagine that the volume limit is intentionally built into the firmware for safety reasons or to prevent distortion.
Noise cancellation works well on these earbuds. It does compensate somewhat for the lack of high volume. A couple different sizes of ear tips are included in the box. For the most part, the Redmi Buds do a great job of blocking out environmental noise.
Battery life is very good, especially for earbuds at this price point. Xiaomi claims 5 hours for the earbuds and 28 hours for the case. I've just been wearing them around the house so far and haven't come close to running them out.
As for other features, the Redmi Buds have touch controls which I haven't totally figured out yet. Two taps on either earbud will pause and play. Triple tap does something and long pressing does something else. There's a huge manual in the box that seems to mostly safety warnings in multiple languages with a lot of pictures to describe what to do. I'll figure them out eventually, but suffice to say that they do have touch control. I am not using these for gaming, so I haven't tried low latency mode. The box includes the earbuds, charging case, 2 sets of different sized tips, a USB-C charging cable, and a (huge) instruction manual.
The good:
- Connectivity is great. Easy pairing and Bluetooth connection.
- Vocal clarity is very good.
- Noise cancellation is good.
- Great battery life. Easy and quick charging.
- IPX4 waterproof. Good for sweat/working out.
- The price is awesome. Xiaomi has included a lot of premium features at a budget price point.

The bad:
- Official app is not available in US and is mostly worthless anyway.
- Low volume and underwhelming bass response. They don't crank.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with these. They are great for everyday use and travel, but if I want truly immersive audiophile sound, I'll have to spring for the extra $$$ and get a premium brand"
Good sound quality love it
Very nice sound they are VERY comfortable to wear thru out the day. They stay in your ear really well. They sound great when full force up. Doesn't crackle at all. They are a great pair !
"I bought these about a month ago because the other ones that I bought had a couple of things that annoyed me. One side decided to give up and die on me, but the one thing that bugged me the most was the wax buildup inside the little rubber pieces that slid onto them.

These particular earbuds are incredible for the price. They sound great. They absolutely do not hurt my ears. I use them everyday that I work out and they never come loose or fall out, which is a major plus for me 👍🏻💪🏻. They connect easily to Bluetooth on my Android phone and have a stable connection throughout the time that I use them. Watch your volume because these things can blow your ears out man.

I've only had them for a short time so if anything comes up I'll adjust my review but for now I'm giving it five stars"
"I have been traveling with these ear buds, they sit comfortably in my ears. Sound quality is very good. pairs with my iPhone and Mac. They last quite a long time, enough for a transatlantic flight. Works well will calls. Amazing price."
"This is my first pair of completely wireless earbuds. Previously, I had the headphones that plugged into my mp3 player; then the blue tooth cheap set from the red circle store that had a cord between the two earpieces. Since I knew the name brand sets were very expensive (to me, anyway), I never thought that Amazon would have a decent set at my price point, but they do.
Having read the reviews on several sets, I decided on this set. Being available in purple was quite the bonus.
As a senior lady who cares about her hearing, I don't wear these all day. About 4 hours a day is my max. I tend to listen to all kinds of music during my walks; and I listen to podcasts while gardening/crafting/household tasks. They can be too loud, but that's what volume controls are for!
I gave this set only 3 stars for noise cancelation because they don't cancel much noise, but that's good for me. I can hear passing cars on my walks; the phone ringing while crafting; my hubby's voice when he offers to bake a frozen pizza for dinner. If you use these on a plane, they will not cancel out any noise, but as I have said, that is not important to me.
They are comfortable, and I hate to sound silly, but so cute! So tiny, and the case is a cute tiny thing, too.
To the case: it is a pain in the behind to get these cute little buggers out of the cast! If I had long nails, I don't think I could get them out! There seems to be some kind of magnetic connection between the buds and the case, so you don't have to worry about them falling out, that's for sure. You do have to worry about bobbling them about as you try to remove them from the case. I can see myself dropping them on the floor of an airplane if I tried to use them on the plane. But other reviewers referred to this problem and I still bought them.
I do like these a lot. They are not expensive and the sound is decent. Would they be good for operatic music? I don't know. The sound of my semi-classical music from my Spotify account is acceptable to me, and I can tell when a piano is out of tune, so my hearing is still good.
I can recommend these for casual users. No sound cancelation. No problem with battery life for me, unlike my previous corded blue tooth set from the red circle store. No regrets at all.
I look forward to using these because they are so nice, cute, and have good sound. I am just careful about where I am when I try to remove them from the case, in case they pop out of my fingers and skitter to the floor."
"These headphones have really good sound quality and fit really nicely into my ears. They charge up really well and I haven't had to charge the actual pack at all yet. They also link up with any device quite quickly. My only complaint is they have a lot of touch activated controls that are hard to remember and when you want them to work they don't seem to but you can accidently set them off really easily. Maybe that is more user error than product though. Overall, wonderful value for the price!"
"I tried other ones at 10x the price and had to return. THESE are just what I wanted, cheap so I don't have to care about them. Pair with phone instantly. Good sound. But the real selling point for me was they didnt have to be jammed into ear like So many other, these are like the real old original apple pod ear buds..... don't hesitate these are great"
"I like these but they are not my favorite. My AirPods are old and weren’t holding a charge very good anymore. Pros: really good battery life, sound quality is fine for me, small compact case. Cons: the double tap to pause is a little hard to get to always work and doesn’t immediately pause like airpods(or some other headphones) and one tap turns the sound up so sometimes it just turns the volume up twice instead of pausing if you don’t do it exactly right; I wish the volume went lower, I like to listen to stuff to go to sleep and the lowest volume is still a bit loud for that.
Not bad headphones at all, and I think the value for the price is reasonable."
"I am very impressed with how these little ear pods perform for the price. I've been using them for a few weeks now and they haven't ever run out of battery while I have been using them. They recharge when placed back in the case. In other words, the case has a rechargeable battery and charges the ear buds. The case is then separately recharged from time to time. When you put the buds back in the case, a green LED lights up indicating the buds are being charged from the battery in the case. When you plug in the case (USB 3), the LED blinks orange indicating the case battery is charging. When the charge is complete, the orange LED goes solid. Excellent design for a very good price. Highly recommended (as long as they last a while!). Will update if anything changes but so far very good!"
"These are okay for the price, but they slowly seem to deteriorate over time, like the sound quality gets worse, the battery life gets shorter etc. the longer you have them, and after about 8 months of use they basically become unusable. The battery life is probably my biggest complaint though."
"These are a great pair of cheap Bluetooth earbuds and they have tremendous sound. It took me quite a bit as I’m in my late 40s to figure out the controls. The voice control annoyance is also a factor here but it is with all Bluetooth headphones. My only gripe with them is there no button and they’re very hard to shut off.

Over time, you learn the one tap, hold and double taps. Holding actually shuts them off while as does putting them in the case will: However, both work but you have a small window before they come back on. Easier to just put them in the case over holding and waiting,

Excellent sound and severely long times of listening before it’s time to charge, I’ve gone many days with 6 hours+. Overall, a great product except the lack of a button. You’ll get use to it:"
"Pretty good quality headphones, the only things I don't like are that they slide out of my ears when I talk chew or bend over, but I think that has more to do with my ears than the product. The controls on these are the most frustrating and inconvenient I've ever experienced on Bluetooth head phones. You have to double tap to pause/play music, and hold down to skip. The issue here is that my music doesn't pause quckly/immediately, which has been inconvenient at work many times. Also, each time I attemt to adjust or push the head phones back in (as I mentioned they slip out constantly, if I smile or chew, bend over, take off a pullover, jump etc., so I need to adjust and push them back in frequently!) So often does me placing them back in my ear cause my music to skip bc I touched it even briefly. I'm poor and have non premium Spotify so I can't go back to whatever is skipped and on top of that it wastes my very limited skips. Absolutely infuriating control settings, I hate it!"
"I was looking for an inexpensive set of earbuds. When these showed up on my Alexa as a price drop, I had to buy them. They fit perfectly in my ears and the ease of pairing to my iPhone was great. I love the purple color. It’s so vibrant. The case is small and trying to get the earbuds out of the case with my nails is sometimes difficult. The quality of these earbuds are great and I would buy them again!"
"I’ve had these for a few months now and they’re pretty awesome. The headphones announce when they’re connected, you can skip a song or go back by tapping the ear buds, and the battery life is better than my last set of AirPods. My ONLY complaint so far is that it’s kind of a pain to get them out of the carrier. Solid 4.5 stars but Amazon won’t let you do halvsies."
"I bought this set because of a Prime Day deal and to replace my almost a year old AirPods. I wasn’t in the mood to spend $100+ for another pair of headphones.
I took a chance based on other reviews and I am quite pleased. They are a beautiful color and have the same sound quality as my AirPods.
The only thing is I have medium nails and pulling the headphones out of the case is a little tricky.
But, I may just need to adjust to them.
I was able to use them a full 3 hours right out of the box without charging. I ended up putting them on the charger just because. They also easily connected to my phone and I am still able to use Siri, and turn the volume up and down as well.
So far, I am impressed.
Will update if any changes in the next few weeks."
"As an avid music lover and someone always on the go, finding the perfect pair of wireless earbuds has been a quest of mine for quite some time. Thankfully, I stumbled upon these Wireless Earbuds with Bluetooth 5.3 and Noise Cancelling Mic, and let me tell you, they exceeded all my expectations!

First and foremost, the sound quality is outstanding. The Bluetooth 5.3 technology ensures a stable and seamless connection, while the advanced drivers deliver rich, immersive sound with crisp highs and deep, punchy bass. Whether I'm jamming out to my favorite tunes or taking a call, the audio experience is consistently top-notch.

The noise-canceling mic is a game-changer, especially for someone like me who is constantly on calls throughout the day. It effectively blocks out background noise, ensuring that my voice comes through loud and clear, even in noisy environments. Plus, the mic's sensitivity is impressive, capturing every nuance of my speech with precision.

Comfort is another area where these earbuds shine. The ergonomic design fits snugly in my ears without causing any discomfort, even during extended listening sessions. They're lightweight and stay securely in place, whether I'm working out at the gym or running errands around town.

One feature I particularly appreciate is the intuitive touch controls. With just a tap or swipe, I can easily adjust the volume, skip tracks, or answer calls without fumbling for my phone. It's incredibly convenient and adds to the overall user experience.

Battery life is also impressive, giving me hours of uninterrupted listening pleasure on a single charge. And when it's time to recharge, the included charging case provides added convenience, allowing me to power up on the go.

In conclusion, these Wireless Earbuds with Bluetooth 5.3 and Noise Cancelling Mic are a true standout in the crowded world of wireless audio. With exceptional sound quality, reliable connectivity, and all-day comfort, they've quickly become my go-to choice for all my audio needs. Whether you're a music enthusiast, a frequent caller, or simply someone who values convenience and quality, these earbuds are sure to impress. Highly recommended!"
"My only issue is the pods are hard to get out of charging unit. I have very small hands but still have a problem removing them.
Sound is good, as is noise cancellation."
"8ve never had a pair of ear buds be comfortable. They put pressure on some part of my ear, or if they're the squishy ones they slowly push out like my head is full of pressure. These are no different. It's probably a me issue, but they push on the cartilage around my ear and hurt a bit after wearing them. I can maneuver them around to be more comfortable, but eventually they do start hurting.

Audio is fine. I did have an instance when they didn't automatically connect, but I was able to select them in my Bluetooth options and they connected. I've never used the controls on purpose, more of an accidental touch but they do work if my accidently pausing my music has any weight.

Removing them from the case is so hard. Why is it so hard? Luckily this means they won't fall out accidently but there is nothing really to grip onto for removal. Your fingers have to be dry and oil free and basically hope on friction catching them and pulling them out."
"My wife has done nothing but rave about these ear buds! They’re very comfortable in the ears, the sound quality is excellent for music, she absolutely LOVES using them for phone calls and watching You Tube videos in private. The buttons were a little hard for her at first until she realized that there is a touch-sensitive area on each that acts as the “buttons”. And to top it all off, they were a “Deal”, from $49 down to $17."
"I needed new earbuds because mine broke and when I came on here to look for earbuds, I saw that these were on sale for $17 originally $42 so I decided to get these. They are so small which I like and I love these. GET THEM"
"Pros:
Battery life, overall sound

Long battery life and good sound that doesn’t completely cancel noise so I know if someone is trying to get my attention, but loud enough to mute unwanted noise.

Cons:
Hard to remove from case, touch sensors on the side

The pieces are small so they’re hard to remove from the case. Also, when they’re in your ear and you need to readjust them or take them out to talk to someone, they’ll pause/change songs, skip a song or 2. It’s very annoying when I’m listening to a song and I put my headphone back in and it has skipped back or ahead from me holding it."
"I’ve had them for two weeks now, use them several times a day and I have yet to charge them once!
The sound is excellent, I switched from my old AirPods and definitely felt the difference. The mic isn’t the best unfortunately but I didn’t expect cheap ear buds to be perfect. Overall these are great and we are ordering a pair for my husband as well"
"I'm not paying a fortune for buds and these are perfect! Good sound quality, and long battery life. If you're answering calls and such it may be difficult because they don't have a button, instead it's a touch area, but I don't use them for that so I'm totally fine."
"I really like how easy they are to pair. They obviously don't listen to commands the way that your apple brand earbuds do. They are hard plastic without any silicone, so just be aware before you order.
The price is right!"
I love the color and they charged quickly. The ear bud keeps falling out of my ear. They work well otherwise.
It has a good quality sound. The only thing that I don't like is the lid. It close too fast and is not easy to pull the earbuds out of the case.
"I really like these earbuds. I will admit that they are not always the loudest and can sound muffled on the other end of a call, but otherwise they are good for listening to music when you need ear buds on a budget."
"its hard for me to take them out of the case, I have thick fingers , wish they can open fully not just 90 degrees . The sound is good"
It has good audio and is a pretty color but it doesn't fit quite right and keeps falling out
"They work great, case can recharge these many times over. The part that goes into the ear is very hard and does bother my ears somewhat. Maybe I have small ears. Quality is great and I hope they last a very long time."
"I like these so far. Holds a decent charge. Has pretty good noise canceling , comfortable, and good sound.

Has some type of magnetism that when put back in device it can ve difficult to get ear buds out but other than that no complaints"
"I bought several headsets, much larger and this has lasted longer, but the batteries are not going to impress you. You really need to buy two so you can swap for a fresh when the battery runs low and the voice inside says 'Battery Low"". the price is right!"
"Hearing is amazing! Don’t purchase two though, my phone gets confused and doesn’t know which one to connect to. That ones probably on me (but that also means you can’t buy a pair as a gift for someone else in your home, like I tried to do)"
I use these pretty regularly. They work pretty good but they are nothin like AirPod quality. I have smaller ears and these fit ok. They will fall out if running or sweating.
I disliked the comfort in my ear but I did like the sound wasn’t to bad and the color choices are great
These headphones are incredible. I usually only keep one ear bud in at a time so the battery lasts so long. I was using them 2-3 hours a day for weeks. WEEKS!! I love them
"Es un poco complicado para sacarlos del case, por lo demás todo bien."
Very nice
"I showed up to the gym twice and forgot my AirPods… I was so upset. When I realized I left my AirPods at home, I decided to buy a backup pair to leave in my gym bag 24/7. I hopped on Amazon and these headphones were on a flash sale so I said what the heck, let’s try it. To be honest, I haven’t used my AirPods since I got these 😂 these are great! I love the sound quality, the battery life is great, durable, and a great value for money. I have not tried to use them to talk on the phone so I can’t comment on that. But, for gym bag headphones, they are perfection.

I use them at least 5 days a week for the gym and running. I have only had to charge them once in the last few weeks. Couldn’t be happier with that!"
"Love the color, great sound, extremely easy to pair to my bluetooth, and easy to use. I would have given them a 5 star rating IF there were a way to raise and lower the volume on the earbuds, but the only way to do that is on my phone, which is a drawback.
As advertise, these are waterproof. I tested it out when one of the earbuds fell out of my ear and onto the shower floor, landing, of course in the water. I was sure that was the end of it, but, I picked it up, shook off the water and it was working fine! There is much good about these earbuds!"
Stopped connecting for calls and audio - suddenly would only connect as an input device. I have another pair and they don't do the same thing. The seller replaced these for me and the new ones work great. Great customer service!
I purchased these headphones for my wife who is hard of hearing. She loves them. Sound quality is great. They fit snuggly & comfortably in ears and they are affordable. Great starter headphones.
"The sound quality is better, it's cheaper so not as worried about losing them. I use these with my mac, auto connects, just a fantastic product."
Great quality earbuds! Sound is nice and functional plus easy to use. Size is perfect to keep in your bag!
"I bought these about a year ago after I lost one of my Airpods. I didn’t wanna drop another hundred dollars on a new set of earbuds, so I settled on these because it seemed like a good deal for the price.

I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the performance and quality of these earbuds. The sound quality had no discernible difference from the name-brand equivalent, the battery lasted me all day, and they sat comfortably in my ears.They’ve been dropped on and flown across tile flooring several times, and they haven’t been damaged at all.

I’m rating it 4 stars, only because of a few nitpicks:

1. The sound control isn’t as precise as I’d like. Even after playing with my phone’s settings to make the headphone audio output as low as possible, I still found the volume too loud even on the lowest setting. (I like to listen on low volume when I’m working or listening to a sleep aid.) Asife from that, I was never able to set the volume above halfway or else it would be way too loud.

2. The sensitivity of the touch control on the actual earbuds is simultaneously too sensitive, and not sensitive enough. I found that whenever I was just trying to take them out of my ears, or adjust them, whatever I was watching or listening to would pause, or skip yo the next track, or disconnect the earbud entirely. But whenever I was actually trying to pause or skip, it took like 3 tries to get there. Call it user error, but I don’t think it should be that finicky.

I’ve had these for a year now, and I’m starting to notice the battery life declining. I can’t have them in for more than 45 minutes without hearing “BATTERY LOW”, so I think it’s time for a new pair. Considering the price though, I’m not mad about it. These are a great option for those like me who are on a budget."
These were a gift to a friend. She likes them and they still work :)
"These have their pros and cons. For me, they fit well in my ears and don't fall out constantly like some other earbuds do. The sound quality is pretty good too. I like that if I adjust them, it doesn't think I'm trying to tap them and change or pause the song or anything. I don't use the tap controls very much so I can't speak for how well that works. One issue I do have is that they are not noise cancelling (unless there is a setting for that that I have not figured out) I can hear everything around me if the volume is not super high. Also if I talk on the phone with them, the other person can hear everything else going on around me very clearly. Other than that, I do like them and I bought two pairs."
This is like the colorful baby brother to AirPods imho. The sound and feel is pretty similar but the packaging is (obviously) punchy and colorful and the carrier case is teeny. I adore it
"Needed to try a new pair of ear buds, the one I had was ok but when I put it in my ear it would almost suction cup to my ear. Just made it feel ick, so I wanted to try a pair of buds with out the little rubber thing on the end. I of course had to pick the pink one, and I love the color! Does get some smudges on it like from rubbing inside your pocket but easily wipes off if it gets a little crazy! I need noise canceling headphones, I have some hearing loss so if I can hear a bunch of noise through them I am not gonna hear for crap. These are great and doesn't make your ears feel itchy and wet with earwax, my ears are super sensitive but these are nice replacement for my headphones. Only reason I marked 4 stars is with these type of headphones, sometimes it's hard to find the right spot where they dont hurt my ear and ear canal, so for me the buds are slightly big for my ear. So if it's not in just right I do get some pain on my tracks. Overall tho, I would definitely recommend the headphones. Quality so far has been great, love the color/style of the case."
"I ha e ne er used this,type of produ t without cord and it's amazing great sound"
"I was looking for a replacement for my AirPods, but didn’t want to spend a ton of money. I came across these and purchase them. They work great, sound good, and stay charged for a long time!"
I tried everything to get a correct fit for my ears so they wouldn’t fall out with minimal activity. Re-gifted to my wife. She loves them and remarks on the quality of the sound.
"Have had these for about 6 months now, and I love them more than my old AirPods! I work 38 hour work weeks and I’m able to use these nearly my entire shift and only I only have to charge them once a week on my off days! Sound quality is also awesome and they’re very comfortable."
"Long battery life, easy to find because they're pink and audio is fantastic. 4 stars because they're painful to put IN your ear."
I like the Fit finish and manufacturing quality as well as the excellent sound these perform every bit as well as many more expensive earbuds that I have recently purchased I was doing a bit of a review and bought a half a dozen different brands all under $30 but as far as bang for the buck goes these are excellent Highly recommended
These work great and I like that I can charge them on the same charging pad as my phone! Good long battery life as well.
Fit great in my ear and long battery life! Very pleasers with this purchase for the price!
only bad thing is that sometimes it doesn't completely turn off when i put them away and close the case . other than that one flaw they're pretty good and comfy i forget they're in my ears sometimes . i've gotten them wet before while showering they still work .
These work great at a great price. Very happy with them. Great price
I rated a 4 because for phone calls people tell me I sound far away or like I'm in a tunnel but for music it's great. I washed my left earbud by accident and it was also dried in the dryer and somehow it still works and sounds just fine! No issues there. They are still working and I've had them for over a year now.
"I accidentally was my earbuds on a nearly monthly basis. Inevitably, they always die, but this pair survived! I’m in shock! Super pleased that they’re still working :)"
Why pay much more for big brand earbuds? These work GREAT!
"Worth the money, I love them, nice pair of headphones I don't see anything wrong with them I use them at UPS and Amazon and they work perfectly fine for me and I've had them for a minute"
The battery lasts for quite a long time and the audio quality is decent.
"I love the price point on these, and the quality is comparable to high-end brands. Seriously reminds me of the first-generation AirPods. That said, they are outdated with the lack of noise-cancelling technology. They hold a charge well and are a bit tricky to get out of the case. Not bad, but not top-tier either."
"With powerful stereo bass, excellent noise-canceling, and a secure fit, they’re perfect for workouts and daily use. The IP7 waterproof rating and 32-hour playtime are huge pluses, and the USB-C charging case is super convenient. Highly recommend!"
Had these for over six months battery life is fantastic. Connectivity with iPhone was spotless.
"Sound is good, setup is easy; however, I'm not crazy about how they fit my ears. Feels like they may fall out if I run. 😒"
"They work great and I use them often. Good quality, although they never feel very snug in my ears. Is this how they're supposed to feel? I don't know but the sound is still rich."
Ok
"Sound quality is nice and clear for the price point. Case is compact so it doesn't take up to much precious pocket space. Great as a small gift or for travel,lounging and school settings. The only annoying thing is and I'm not alone looking at other reviews, is that taking them out of the case(""very dropable""). Just don't try to take them out while leaning over a high ledge and you should be fine."
"First of all, for the price it's all good. Now I've not tested for longevity but so far so good. These are small, slim, sleek, slippery feel. They look nice and decent quality. The sound is decent. The only real issue I've had is getting them out. The pods are positioned so close to each other in the small case that it is difficult to get a grip on them. Other than that, they seem worth the price."
"I like these earbuds and they fit neatly and comfortable in my ears and the sound quality for calls and music is loud and clear. However, they are a little smaller than usual so if you have big ears, they might be a little loose."
Have a little echo in them
"Liked the design, solid plastic-no rubber tip!!
Good price.
Good sound.
Good fit, good weight, easy to use-can hardly tell they are in place.
If only the case had a meter to tell what the charge level, they’d be pretty darn perfect."
"I was skeptical about these for the price but they've impressed me. Good sound quality and fairly comfortable though when worn for a few hours, my ears get a little sore."
"I am happy with these ear plugs. Only little nit is they fall out of my ears easily and when I put them back in if I'm not careful it skips to the next song or gets too loud because the controls are in the neck. That's a poor design, but wow, the sound quality is awesome. Minus 1 star due to poor design. That said, I still recommend these ear plugs, the minor nits are worth living with because of the great sound."
Good headphones. I didn’t have any problems.
"Tienen buen sonido, les dura mucho la batería igual en la caja hay muy buena reserva para cargar. El único detalle es que por ser rígidos me incomodan un poco, el problema no es el producto sino el diseño de mis orejas que no son muy convencionales. Por lo que si lo recomiendo y mucho..."
Really love these headphones for the price! Audio is great. They look and feel high end / expensive. Small and compact case. My only complaint is that they are very hard to take out of the case since the case is so small. I have to dig at the earphones to pull them out and hope it does not get damaged due to this.
Works really well for the cost
"I'm not an AirPods person, so when I looked at the prices for AirPods on Apple's website, I wasn't gonna fork over $100-$300 worth of AirPods only to lose them, so I went on Amazon to find some knock-offs for a cheaper price.

Have to say I'm impressed. They stay in my ears pretty well, which I was a little worried about. I love the different color choices too (something Apple doesn't have or does for theirs). The charge for the case is type C and comes with a type C charger in the box (it's the smaller box, so don't throw it out before taking it out. I almost did 😂).

So while these don't fit any AirPods case, I've found an alternate route: they fit in some of my Bath&Body works Hand sanitizer pouch holders--it's the perfect size that when I try to take it out, it takes me a minute to get it out because it's in there so good (so we know it's not going anywhere. I don't think they'll fit in the hard cases tho, great for the silicone holders though! And to take it out, just pinch the top of the silicone case as you pull the sides down and off the ear-pods case."
So far they work well
"Incredible price and great sound !!
I’m so good at losing these and washing them. I keep buying the cheap ones and couldn’t be happier. I wish they had an app to make better adjustments but on sale for 9 bucks couldn’t beat it!"
Got these for my husband as he is working from home due to medical condition and he is loving them. Great sound
"Still searching for ear buds that don't hurt after extended wearing, and these are the closest I've gotten the yet. Look nice and don't have any issues with it staying connected - in fact I think the range is longer than my name brand ones that I was replacing. They're very light which makes it easier to wear for a while, but the shape still fits oddly in my ear and starts to fall out after a while. The sound is fine, but I never notice ""bad"" sound v ""good"" sound so... Overall, I like them and still keep using them until the touch controls start driving me insane (there VERY sensitive)."
No complaints. Work well. Affordable enough to not worry about losing them. I believe my son is on his third pair.
Everything you would want for the money.. small with great sound..quality is good
"Take into consideration, I've never used airpods so I can't compare these to those. I have however purchased well regarded Soundpeats in the past which I found horribly harsh and tinny. As for the sound of these earbuds, they are much more mid focused with quite a bit of warmth, while still remaining fairly neutral in the sub bass territory. They are a bit muddy in the low mids, but you can't expect perfection at this price lol. Bass heads may be underwhelmed, but my typical headphone of choice is a pair of Sennheiser HD600 which sound perfect to my ears and also don't have a lot of sub bass. The multiple pairs of Bluetooth earbuds I've tried before these have been super scooped with overwhelming sub bass and harsh highs, whereas these are much more neutral to my ears and are considerably less ear fatiguing than many headphones. Purchased February 2023 and still going strong!"
"Great product for the price. Nice color, comfortable to wear and sound/mic quality is good!"
They have decent audio quality for what your paying and the battery life is good too. The case is standard but does it's job well. The range is better than I expected from these to and the auto pair to your phone actually works. If you need a pair of cheap reliable ear buds these will do the job great.
It’s a very small case but I love them they have very long range and let’s me know when I’m disconnected. Must buy. Set up was very easy mic quality is clear
"These are great for the price and function yada yada but my issue is I like to wear them at night while listening to a meditation to go to sleep. The volume is so loud! I can’t make them any quieter for my level of comfort, the next option down is no sound at all.
Other than that, they are ok."
"These earbuds are literally the best. Comfortable, they don’t move from the ear and also the sound quality is the best.
I bought them for the second time since the first pair I lost them and will buy again from this.
Also the battery lasts forever and the first pair I used them for a long time with no issues until I lost them. The blue color is cute"
Muy bueno. buen sonido y fácil de emparejar
"These were super comfortable for about a day, and then my ears really really scared to ache. After about a week of using them (for about 8 hours a day) the ear I’m constantly using is extremely sore and I think I’m developing a callous 😭 idk if I just have small ear holes or what. I got these bc my wired apple earbuds also really hurt my ears so they’re about the same in that aspect but otherwise these are so nice!! Amazing battery life, great noise cancelling, I do struggle to get them out of the case with my fat little fingers hahah but other than those 2 personal things, great product!!"
So I love the color! I like the sound quality and they are very comfortable. They haven’t fallen out of my ears so far. I really like them and the only problem I have with them so far is that the case feels a bit slippery because of how smooth it is. The ear buds are kind of hard to get out and the top likes to try and snap itself closed while you’re trying to get the buds out. But other than that they are great. The controls are easy to use. I think I’ll try and find a case for it to help out some of the slipperynessand what not.
"I got about 5 months of use out of these. I like them, the sound is clear and the charge holds well. After 5 months of use the charge box quit working without notice... But, for the discounted price paid, I think it's not bad. I like the pause and volume functions built into the bud."
"It’s really not comparable to the more popular brand names who have mastered the wireless ear buds. However, they’re inexpensive and do the trick. Performance wise, there’s a delay, which the manual it comes with warns you about. Does not work well with constant stop/start of music or streaming aps. Does what it needs and I won’t be as upset if they’re misplaced or lost."
Thank you
I was shocked they are almost like apple headphones work pretty easily and comfortable
"I bought these to replace my AirPods, which I use mostly at the gym. These are the same quality and work well for workouts & wearing around the house or at work. They’re slippery when running, so I wouldn’t recommend them for that. But I would recommend AirPods for that purpose either. They’re super comfortable. I have my tragus pierced & no problem wearing these. Love the pink too!"
"Pros:
- Pairs and switches well with multiple devices (my Android and my PC)
- Decent sound
- Decently comfortable (and I'm REALLY picky)

Cons:
- Battery life of the earbuds is just ok
- No ANC (which would be a miracle at this price)"
"Sound quality is okay for this price. They are very light, comfortable and small. Minus one star because they do not control volume level and app is not available when I scan barcode."
"Honestamente, el sonido que emite el audífono es nítido, el confort del audífono en el oído muy suave en mi primera impresión y en efecto la calidad parecen de mentira, no pesan nada, son muy ligeros y el emparejamiento a mi teléfono Samsung S20 FE podría calificarlo como DEMASIADO bueno, solo abrí la tapita del case y se emparejaron SUPER rápido como que si mi teléfono fuese Redmi, insano."
"Easy to operate, good product quality, very satisfied."
I was hoping for it to blow my head off but its still attached. Its pretty quiet but even when on the road its still enjoyable. It lets you hear what is going on outside. So it has no noice cancellation and its as if noise transparency is on at all times. I was hoping for an app to tune these buds like other headphones but it doesnt. But still good just a bit too quiet. Btw it works alot for calls and im super quiet when on the phone i pretty much whisper and people still hear me no matter what.
"Despite not being Apple airpods, these earbuds do the trick. They are very responsive and have strong battery life. I can tap the earbud and it instantly works and responds to my phone apps.
If you want to save some money on Apple airpods, this product is a cheap, efficient, alternative.
Something to note; the case is wireless charging and uses USB-C connection to charge the case.
Overall, a steal in price comparied to how expensive other earbuds are listed on the internet."
Overall had these for about a month. So far so good. Sound quality is good but not too much bass. For the price I think these are great. Been using them for my outdoor walks and have only charged them once so far. They seem to fit well even while moving around. Highly recommend for the price.
"Me encantaron, aunque tenen varios puntos negativos, el volumen es algo bajo, la calidad es decente para su precio (osea no es la mejor precisamente), los botones tactiles casi no me funcionan nose porqué, sin embargo la bateria les dura mucho, pero de verdad me dejan asombrado, tengo unos semi in hear que uso para el dia a dia que son superiores a estos en todo lo anterior menos en la duracion de bateria y cuestan el doble, estos los compré para el gym, estan geniales para lo poco que cuestan."
"Buenos audífonos inalámbricos ideales para ovaciones casuales. Un gran punto es su material ya que se siente muy satisfactorio. El sonido es bueno pero no lo mejor del mercado por eso no le doy 5 estrellas, pero sin duda un gran compra"
Good quality for this price
"Excelente carga, perfecto para viajes largos. El sonido es suficientemente bueno, no es profesional, pero si lo que se quiere es tener tu música por mucho tiempo está genial. Aunque no lo utilizo para llamadas, las pocas que he hecho usando los Redmi Buds 4 Active han sido sin problemas para escuchar o para que me escuchen a mí."
"El sonido es pobre, lo único que sobresale es la duración de la batería.
La comodidad es regular una hora con ellos y ya dolía un poco en oído."
Me agradó su comodidad y sonido
Funcionan bien
"Me gustaron mucho, les dura mucho la carga de batería y con un buen sonido."
Su batería dura lo que debería
"Mi primera impresión fue que son bastante livianos. Pensé que eran de mentira jajaja

Luego que empecé a usarlos me encantaron. Los recomiendo. Los puse a cargar tan pronto llegaron a mis manos y llevo una semana usándolos desde que los compré y aún no los he puesto a cargar, la batería ha durado demasiado y yo los uso todos los días, eso sí, en mi ritmo de trabajo solo uso un bus a la vez todos los días.

El sonido es excelente, fácil de usar."
Los materiales son muy buenos y el sonido excelente por el precio se recomienda totalmente
ok
"Tiene buen sonido buen bajo aunque el sonido es un poco bajo, les doy un 9"
"Excelente como todo lo de Xiaomi
Conexión inmediata"
I love the sleek look of the earbuds but the only downside is this product doesn't come with any type of charging cord. Luckily I'd purchased a cord for another device and it fit perfectly.
Got this on sale for like 16 dollars. Can't beat that price and was pretty good quality. Sound isn't great but works.
Buenas cancelación pasiva de ruido
"Suenan bien, son comodos pero la bateria no dura mucho. Buena calidad por el precio que se esta pagando."
I'm very happy with my purchase.
"Buen sonido, buena duración de batería y sus controles con los toques lo hacen perfectos"
Se escucha nítido
muy bueno el precio...
Muy buenos x lo q pagas
"llegaron segun lo solicitado, buen producto , faciles de configurar."
"These are easy to sync up compared to some others. For an inexpensive, easy to use ear buds I really recommend these little guys"
These are proof of you get what you pay for. They have NO noise canceling.
"Buenas compra
Exelente!!"
"No tienen un volumen tan alto, ni bajos pero son aceptables por el precio pagado"
"Value for money is okay, not so great but at least it makes the job. I don’t like it doesn’t last much (battery) also they don’t come with the cable or charger. It’s very confusing to do the commands."
look good at this price
"Nice headphones good price , not feel the sound is outstanding but battery is awesome , nice product at nest price

Noise suppression is really good"
I'm coming down from Airpods gotta say this thing surprised me for the price i wasn't expecting this quality music sounds great of you do make calls it's okay thou.
"No me gustó mucho, espere más del producto, tiene bajo sonido"
"Aisla el ruido, buen producto"
ESTAN BIEN PARA EL COSTO
"Muy buena duración de batería, buenas calidad de audio, aunque un poco bajo el volumen"
Muy buena calidad
"If you’re looking for a cheap earbud, that’s a good call. I needed it asap and didn’t want to invest money in a expensive one.
Got what I paid for. Simple"
Muy buenos
"Cuando están al alcance, es perfecto, sin embargo, al llevar mi teléfono (o cualquier dispositivo) en mi bolsillo, y estar conectado a mis audífonos, no se puede escuchar nada de la manera fluida que se espera (señal altamente interrumpida)"
Excelente calidad de sonido y cómodos!
Todo muy bueno
Great earbuds for the price. Audio quality is really great. Great battery life so far. The Redmond connectivity was rather simple and easy to my iPhone. Noise cancellation is good as well not AirPod Pro quality standards but for $16/17 these are great. Would recommend
"It's easy to use, very nice quality, and very comfortable."
"Let’s start talking about the battery, it doesn't last long. If you're on a call, you have to switch sides or you'll soon run out of battery.
Another negative point is the sound. super low. If you are on the street you can't hear well what the other person is saying.
And finally, the app they suggest downloading to control the buds doesn't open in the USA. I can't know how much battery it has or anything about it.
Maybe I'll try another model from this brand. But I don't recommend this one."
"Los audífonos suenan bastante bien, y además estaban a muy buen precio ($16.99). Totalmente recomendados. Valen la pena."
LO RECOMIENDO
tiene 2 segundos de atraso para los jugadores en lunes. Son muy cómodos tiene buena bateria
Fue un regalo para mí mamá y le encantaron. Llegó rápido y en excelente condiciones.
Buenisimos para su precio excelentes calidad
Excelente producto buen sonido.
"Excellent value, and the sound was awesome for that price."
"Not bad, feels comfortable and sounds is pretty good. Could have more bass
But for 16$ can't ask for more."
Got these on sale and honestly there’s nothing more i could ask at this price. It excels at basic task. Connectivity is good. Redmi Application is fast and fluid. Sound is awesome. Base is good. Using with iphone. No problems at all. 5 stars.
"Recibí antes de la fecha y el producto llegó en perfectas condiciones. Fácil de usar, lo que más me gusta es que tienen cancelación de sonido y un buen micrófono. Completamente satisfecha con mi compra!"
No trae cargador! Eso me parece super incomodo la verdad.
"They fall out of my ear, randomly cut off and don't last 10 hours of my 12 hour work shift. I push one back into my ear and it's so sensitive that it either hangs up the phone or cuts my music off. I would also have preferred ones that have a digital charging screen to let me know that they are charging. I don't think this item has a 'charging case'. I feel like the earbuds aren't charging unless they are plugged into a usb-c cord."
Muy buen sonido y aislamiento en relación al precio
"Llevo 3 semanas usandolos. El micrófono funciona mejor de lo esperado, percibo calidad, la carga de batería dura, el audio es aceptable. El vendedor es cuidadoso con la cajas, llegaron impecables."
"Greatly exceeded my expectations for form factor, ease of pairing, design, ergonomics, case, and comfort while wearing. I didn't realize the case has a battery, LED, and magnetic snaps. I've tried all three rubber ear adapters, but even the largest falls out of my ear during exercise. Music from mp3s sounded tinny even after trying EQ adjustment. Very cool, but the two problems (fit and sound quality) are deal breakers."
Great sound quality and easy connection. There is an app available but it's not necessary. They fit great and come with many different size tips. Highly recommend!
"El sonido, no es tan bueno. Le dura bastante la batería, son impermeables"
"Perfectos, livianos y no se caen"
Lo mejores sin duda
Para el precio esta muy bien
Perfecto
Very low sound even when volume is all the way up.
It didn't come with a charger not sure if that's normal but was very disappointed about that
The right of the earbuds died only 3 hours after fully charged. No signals to show the battery volume.
"Estos audífonos Redmi buds 4 Active son de mala calidad, no ajustan bien y el sonido es malo. He comprado anteriormente unos bud 4 Lite y se escucha mejor siendo más baratos. Aconsejo no comprarlos porque por menos dinero se compra algo de mejor calidad."
The battery on these last about 2 hours max. They make wild claims about battery life and it is not true in any way whatsoever.
"TL;DR: DON'T BUY, YOU'RE WELCOME. I bought these because of the low price and Xiaomi brand as I have a lot of products from them, including Redmi phones and the other wireless ear pods that look a bit like Apple ones. Hoped these will be same or at least not worse, but frankly they are rather horrible. Falling out of the ear, sound quality is mediocre, there are intermittent disconnects, basically I didn't even bother returning them, as too much trouble. What a write-off of $30 AUD."
first test and it failed miserably. People can't hear my voice if TV was on or if there was people talking near me. The caller will hear the background noise more than my own voice. Just go with a different brand.
"Estos audífonos no sirven su propósito en lo absoluto. Siempre se están cayendo, he probado con todos cauchos que trae la con ninguno logran ajustarse al oído. Pésimo producto. Absolutamente decepcionado. No los recomiendo para nada."
The product came without it charger. So disappointed
Suenan muy suave entonces no se alcanza a saber la calidad de los audífonos
Very cheap. But quality is also very low. Feels very low quality. Absolutely no bass. Can’t connect to 2 devices at the same time. Have to disconnect one and then connect other.
Wasn't loud enough
Zero stars
"These only supports sbc codec. I first tried this with a bluetooth transmitter that supports bluetooth 5.3. You have to manually enable the low latency mode with the touch controls, but it seems to work with this adapter.

== Android ==

Android experience seems alright. Connecting is quick. You get a notification with battery status for each bud (this battery status also shows up when paired to other devices). Touch controls are basic: track control, and pause. I'm only on bluetooth 5.1 here so I don't think I'm getting the low latency feature here even when I enable it.

Android offered to set up 'Find My Device'. There is also the ability to ring the earbud if you lose it without enabling that. Sound is not very loud, but still would be helpful locating a misplaced bud.

There is a QR code to download a Xiaomi app. It takes me to their site which redirects to a US subdomain, and then to the play store app, but the play store says ""This item isn't available in your country"". So much for firmware updates or toggling features from the phone I guess.

== Physical ==

These have oblong silicone earbud tips. The medium looked closer to normal small size, but I still had to switch to the small for a good fit (I normally use the small size). Fit is comfortable. They are light and pretty unobtrusive. I found the light weight with the oblong tip does a good job keeping the earbud in place even though they lack positive retention.

The charging case with buds weighs about 41.5g. The pair of buds is only 7.6g.

== Usage ==

Instructions are a bit too Ikea, and then the text explanations that do exist are on different pages than the picture instructions so it is difficult to decipher them.

Low latency mode has to be manually enabled by holding both bud's touch buttons for 1.5 seconds. A 3-tone chime plays. You can't turn it back off without putting them back in the case.

The buds seems to handle switching devices OK. I can disconnect on my phone, turn my transmitter on, and they pair to it. To get them back on the phone I have to manually connect again though. I didn't find any automatic method so I don't have to interact with the currently paired device though.

They are not the best at blocking external sounds out, but this is probably desirable in an active bud where you want to hear your surroundings."
"The overall design is simple. The matte black case fends off smudges well and so do the stem buds. In the hands, both the case and the buds feel very light and somewhat cheap. But that’s not such a bad thing as the weight allows the buds to not be felt in the ear after a little while. When listening on the couch or relaxing, they are great. However, in my experience, the oval shape of the buds makes them slippery with a bit of sweat when doing light housework or walking, and I had to constantly adjust them, which is very distracting. I worry they might fall off when running or doing dynamic exercise. By the way, training or heavy sweat is not a problem due to the IPX4 rating.

The buds paired easily with my Android phone using the fast pair feature. Bluetooth 5.3 allowed the buds to stay connected at decent distances without hiccups. The touch controls worked well for the most part, but I am disappointed that there seems to be no volume option. The 5-hour battery life is pretty good for a day’s on-off regular use, but for those extended listening sessions, the quick charge feature adds over 1.5 hours in just 10 minutes of charging. The case adds up to 28 hours. There is no wireless charging option and there is no USB-C cord included.

Although there is no active noise cancellation, by choosing the proper included tips, a good amount of noise is blocked and not a problem when playing. The call quality is more than decent, as I heard clearly, and even the wind was barely an issue. The app is minimal but adds a bit more customization. Sadly, there is no touch control customization or EQ. The low latency mode allowed lag or sync to be almost unnoticeable.

The 12mm drivers deliver a sound signature that actually surprised me. The bass has some kick without being too boomy and adds a warm tone to the sound signature. The midrange is present, and the treble is a bit recessed but still bright enough to add some clarity. I must stress that the sound quality heavily depends on the right ear tips.

These buds are as basic as they come. However, one must consider that they are a budget item. If it wasn’t for the fitting issue (it could be different for others), these would be my daily drivers when working out. I still say that they are inexpensive enough to have as a spare or for the kids."
"I received the Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 for review several weeks ago and have put them through some good testing in different settings - indoors, outdoors, quiet, and loud environments - and I was very surprised at the quality of their sound, connection, and fit for the price. I was able to take advantage of the fast pair option because I have an Android device - it worked well even after un-pairing them. I can attest that they are IPX4 rated because they are still working even after using them when I was sweating buckets during an outdoor activity.

The only reason I can't rate them a 5-star is due to a couple of shortcomings: 1) While they produce decent sound, they aren't the best; and 2) Perhaps the sound might be better if I could download the proprietary app to customize the proper settings (not available in the US). Overall, not a bad option if you're looking for affordable wireless ear buds."
"These Redmi Buds 4 Active ear buds from Xiaomi are a very nice budget-friendly option. These are not going to compete at the multi-hundred dollar level of some other brands but at this low a price they are exceptionally capable. The ear buds are very lightweight making them comfortable to wear.

The ear buds have good battery life; Xiaomi seems uncertain how much battery life as they state up to 28 hours in some places and then up to 30 in others. Also, the battery life has a little asterisk next to it in the listing with no definition as to why it is there. What they really should be saying to clarify the battery life is that the ear buds have a battery life around five hours but then the case can charge the ear buds multiple times leading to the total life of 28 (or 30?) hours.

The ear buds are listed as IPX4 with one image going so far as to state ""...hitting the gym and breaking a sweat"" but there is one of those pesky asterisks again. The asterisk is of course not detailed in the product listing but in checking with Xiaomi that asterisk translates to ""Please try to avoid using your earbuds during strenuous exercise, sweat during exercise may cause damage to the device"". Those two quoted statements seem to contradict each other.

There is also basic touch control built into the ear buds which is again nice at the price point. They also feature basic noise cancellation which works reasonably well.

Even with all the marketing asterisks, these are a quality set of ear buds when you consider how inexpensive they are."
"I was surprised to find Xiaomi products available in the US. This is a very well known brand abroad, but almost unknown here.
About the features and performance: Balanced sound profile, just a bit biased towards bass, light, perfect fit and affordable. It has ENC which helps with voice clarity for people on the other side of a call. Fast pair which is usually only found in way more expensive earbuds. And there is an almost useless phone app.
Negative points: The product description is very deceiving, since it advertises 'noise cancellation' without spelling out it is ENC (environment noise cancellation) and not ANC (ambient noise cancellation). One might skim through the text and believe they are ordering earbuds with ANC. I really do not like when manufacturers do that. And I really missed the ability to pair/connect to two devices, which is now table stakes at this price point."
"I got these for everyday listening, specifically for their sound-blocking due to using silicone inserts. They take a little positioning to get a good seal, then they sound good and block sound well. For the cost these are good.

Earbuds are build decently. They require some working in each time to get a good seal.

Sound quality is good. When seated properly bass goes down to 10Hz, but if they aren't fully in bass is poor. Highs sound a little muffled, but nothing major.

Touch controls are basic, just play/pause, next track, and call answer/hangup. They do support low-latency (long-touch both sides). No way turn on/off without the case, as is common these days.

App isn't available in the USA. I manually downloaded and installed the app and selected a different region. It doesn't offer any special features, other than firmware updates (none was available)."
"I use this as a backup pair of buds for when I occasionally misplace my primaries. These do a passable job at voice calls, just a bit tinny. Music, not so much. Will likely replace these with something < $50 but higher quality."
"At $18, these are... fine. The sound quality is mediocre, there is no noise cancelling, the charge lasts a decent while, they fit ok. On the down side, they feel cheap but that can be good in that they're light weight. The case is small and easy to pocket. Overall, they're exactly what I would expect for the price."
I was surprised that these sound so well. They are of course lacking in bass but music and voice are crystal clear. No issues connecting to my S21+ phone. Battery lasts 8 or more hours pending on the volume setting. I can recommend these for a low cost set.
"At this price they are pretty much disposable and I’m fine letting my kids use these at the risk of being lost. However the sound quality is decent enough that I’d use them for casual use cases. They’re ok to wear, not uncomfortable but not something I’d probably want all day either.

The buttons work to play and pause but when trying to force into pairing mode to connect with a new device I can’t get them to do it. The instructions say to touch both ear buds 3 times at the same time but it doesn’t seem to work. To pair to a new device I had to walk out into the yard to get away from the other device, turn them on, and pair with the new one. It’s annoying but I don’t need to change them that frequently."
"Using these with a Pixel 7, the one touch connect was straight forward. Go to your bluetooth settings and after you open the buds they try to connect with your phone (it's usually the other way around where you have to choose the device), just press connect and go (albeit connecting any bluetooth headphones is easy also). The nice part is shows the battery status when you look at your bluetooth devices. My other headphones would just die without notice, so it's nice knowing when I need to charge. The sound quality at this price point is really amazing! Boomy bass and crisp highs, the caveat being you have to choose the correct tips. I tried them first with the tips that came on default and I thought the sound was very lacking. I have another set of similar style buds that I really like, so I was comparing these Xiaomi's to those to figure out if the Xiaomi's were any good. I didn't think it was close at first, with my older one's being way better, but then just for kicks I swapped bud tips and it made a big difference! My older ones no longer sounded good, and the Xiaomi's sounded great! There is not a big selection of tips included (2 other sizes), but luckily one of the included sizes worked or I would've have to kept the bud tips swapped with my older set. These are my new favorite cheap wireless headphones! I don't know about 30 hrs of battery life, but I got a solid 8 hrs of constant play from 100% and ended on 20% battery left. The noise cancelling on a phone call is decent, but it all hinges on having the right size bud tips on. The touch controls work but I have never gotten a pair wireless buds with touch to work properly, these are no exception. You have to know the correct number of ""taps"" to do a function. Not worth being a selling point. Overall, these are easy recommend for what they are, a good pair of low cost wireless headphones!"
"I was wanting to be wowed by the Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 Active. The price is fantastic, and I thought they might be a worthy budget alternative to Airpods and other high end wireless earbuds. While the connectivity is great and the feature set is impressive with the Redmi Buds 4, they are sonically underwhelming. So while they are a nice pair of earbuds at a great price, you won't mistake them for Airpods or Bose Quiet Comfort earbuds or Beats or any other premium earbud.
The first thing you'll notice when unboxing these is the case. It is a sleek little black rounded square. A bit light and a little slick but sharp looking design-wise. The charging port is at the bottom with an unobtrusive LED next to it.
Connectivity is great. The Redmi Buds easily paired to my Android phone and connect right away every time, even with the phone locked or charging. Xiaomi has an app for these, but if you try to get it through the Play Store, it isn't available in the US. I imagine the same is true for iOS. I downloaded and installed the APK and had to tell the app I was from Canada. But I found that the Xiaomi Earbuds app was mostly unnecessary. There's not much the app can do that is not available in the basic Android settings. Xiaomi says you need the app for firmware updates, and you can turn on low-latency mode for gaming through the app. Battery status and find device are available through Android settings without using the app.
Now let's get down to brass tacks and talk about sound. I'm a bit of an audiophile and like my music loud and clear. I found the Redmi Buds to be underwhelming in the audio department. Vocal clarity is great, and they work well for voice calls. They are also great for anything with speech - videos, movies, TV or what have you. For music, I found the bass response to be poor overall. The volume is also too low for me. I like to crank my audio gear to 11 (at least some of the time), and these don't crank. Turned all the way up, the Redmi Buds won't blow you away. You won't feel like you're at the concert. I would imagine that the volume limit is intentionally built into the firmware for safety reasons or to prevent distortion.
Noise cancellation works well on these earbuds. It does compensate somewhat for the lack of high volume. A couple different sizes of ear tips are included in the box. For the most part, the Redmi Buds do a great job of blocking out environmental noise.
Battery life is very good, especially for earbuds at this price point. Xiaomi claims 5 hours for the earbuds and 28 hours for the case. I've just been wearing them around the house so far and haven't come close to running them out.
As for other features, the Redmi Buds have touch controls which I haven't totally figured out yet. Two taps on either earbud will pause and play. Triple tap does something and long pressing does something else. There's a huge manual in the box that seems to mostly safety warnings in multiple languages with a lot of pictures to describe what to do. I'll figure them out eventually, but suffice to say that they do have touch control. I am not using these for gaming, so I haven't tried low latency mode. The box includes the earbuds, charging case, 2 sets of different sized tips, a USB-C charging cable, and a (huge) instruction manual.
The good:
- Connectivity is great. Easy pairing and Bluetooth connection.
- Vocal clarity is very good.
- Noise cancellation is good.
- Great battery life. Easy and quick charging.
- IPX4 waterproof. Good for sweat/working out.
- The price is awesome. Xiaomi has included a lot of premium features at a budget price point.

The bad:
- Official app is not available in US and is mostly worthless anyway.
- Low volume and underwhelming bass response. They don't crank.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with these. They are great for everyday use and travel, but if I want truly immersive audiophile sound, I'll have to spring for the extra $$$ and get a premium brand"
Good sound quality love it
Very nice sound they are VERY comfortable to wear thru out the day. They stay in your ear really well. They sound great when full force up. Doesn't crackle at all. They are a great pair !
"I am an almost permanent user of earbuds but tend to look to those with active noise cancelling and good sound quality. I am currently using Bose Qc 2's and (as ever) the reproduction is great but the mic quality is awful.
Generally I've found that cheaper earbuds provide a better balance, reproduction is ok with a better mic quality for outgoing calls.

I keep the ""high end"" earbuds with me all of the time but sometimes I may forget to take them so I keep ""emergency spare earbuds"" in my vehicles ""just in case.""

These were recommended to me by a friend and so far I have been pleasantly surprised.

Reproduction is reasonable and outgoing call quality is great.

They are not my style for comfortable fit (like Apple earbuds) however they are not uncomfortable either.

The case is very small and charged with usb c.

So for the purpose that they were bought for I am very happy."
"I originally bought this because I’m using a Xiaomi phone. I’m not usually one to write reviews, but I accidentally put it through both the washer and dryer (one of them was in one of my pockets). I didn’t realize until I found it while folding clothes. I was terrified it wouldn’t work anymore, but to my surprise, it still works perfectly! Definitely worth a 5-star review."
"Nice design, the sound is not the best but it’s ok for the price. Last battery is acceptable. The worst thing is doesn’t have button. If you miss the charger case it’s very hard to use them! You can not answer calls trough the earbuds and you can’t hang up calls is not very comfortable. That is the reason that I give 4 starts instead 5"
Un producto genial...
"Can't fit my ears, falls off all the time"
Bueno y barato
"It has good sound and the battery life is very good, which I recommend. I dropped 1 hearing aid in the water and I realized about 3 minutes later and I put them on and they worked without any problem.
I've been using them for 2 months because the price is a good hearing aid."
Incómodos no se escucha fuerte molestan nada ergonomics no lo recomiendo para nada
El sonido no es muy alto pero no está mal lo demás perfecto
"Mejor, claro que podria ser, pero tiene muy buena duracion y sonido por el precio, lo malo es que no posee cancelacion de ruido."
Todo bien
"Fits good in my ears.i wear them for sleep.feels very comfortable.wont fall out easily.dont hurt my ears .long battery life and light weight.
Sound is a little on the low side. I usually have it at 50 to 60 perfect volume."
"Los había comprado para un amigo y me comentó que la calidad, el sonido y la cancelación de ruido exterior era muy bueno, sin embargo, la esposa lavó los audífonos en un pantalón jajajajaja"
"The sound is fine, they are plenty comfortable and I like that they do not have noise cancelation so I can wear them and not have to remove them if I am interacting with someone, however one of the buds stopped producing sound randomly after a few days and looks like it is not charging while in the case, while the other still charges fine. Probably got a lemon but it is disappointing."
"Muy buenos audífonos. Suenan duro, son de muy buen material, cuentan con fast pair y la batería dura muchísimo, jamás se me han descargado antes de dejarlos de usar, y los uso por horas."
"Auriculares acordé al precio, batería super durable, no se conecta a dos dispositivos al mismo tiempo por eso le doy 3 estrellas y aunq el sonido es bueno en las llamadas debo subir mucho la voz porque las personas en la llamada no me escuchan bien y dicen q se escucha muy bajo!"
Buen Producto 100 % recomendado
"Buena compra, buena calidad"
Very disappointing. These do not pair in Low Latency as advertised. They most likely do not use APTX or APTX LL. Otherwise they do stay in my ears and would have worked fine for my needs.
Great headphones for the price. They fit and work very good.
"El sonido cómo su cancelación de sonido deja mucho que desear, puedes mantener una conversación con una persona normalmente aún usando los audios a todo volumen, el material se siente de buena calidad y no son tan ligeros"
"I like everything about the earbuds except for them not staying securely in my ears which unfortunately makes them useless for me.
Do I have unusual ears? I don't think so, but I also don't see a lot of other people complaining about the fit.
I also have Xiaomi Mi True Wireless Earbuds Basic 2 which fit me much better, but of course they have completely different form factor."
"En computadora se eschuca bien pero en dispositos Xiaomi suena muy bajo, la Cancelacion de Sonido solo es para llamadas, Para ser el Precio no esta mal pero son muy molesto al tener mas de 1 hora de usos continuo"
"The only reason I'm not giving a five star is because it's not very loud, but everything g else works good it connects really fast not sure if it's because my phone is the same brand. The case is small and nt bulky. Sad part is it keeps falling out my ear, I hve small ears"
"Al in all is pretty good,"
"Got these to use for TV listening because I don’t care for the over-the-ear style for long periods. The sound quality is simply not great, but the biggest issue is that you cannot control the volume from the buds…you have to do that from the connected device."
"The price is good, but the material quality is poor. At maximum volume, the music is barely audible and has a cheap sound."
Excelente relación calidad precio. Muy buenos graves condiderando que cuestan cerca de $30. Muy buena opción si no quieres gastar mucho. Son comodos y muy buena duración de la batería
Un regalo para mi sobrino y quedo encantado con ellos.
"El volumen se escucha bajo comparado a otros audífonos, molesta un poco en la oreja pero funcionan muy bien"
Buena calidad
Excelente calida y funcionalidad
"the left buds doesn't work right, it is always sounding less strong than the right one"
"Los he usado un dia y me parecen muy buenos, se conectan muy rapidos. 100% recomendado"
Listening to music
"Got it 2 days ago, easy to connect to my Samsung phone, mic quality is good, no noise canceling and quality of the plastic is not high but these buds have the best value anyone can get for this price! So satisfied with it and yes! will buy it again"
"They are compact , easy to use. The biggest problem is they not lound enough, at least on my Samsung S6 and Note 8, compared to my Bose QC buds in transparent mode. Max volume can be covered by 3-person in door conversation. Outdoor, don't even think about it."
"Very bad choice, they are too big so they they hold inside your ear."
"Excelentes audífonos en precio y calidad, los bajos suenan muy bien y tienen buen micrófono, lo único es que si tienes una oreja pequeña no te van a quedar bien. A mi esposa no le quedaron bien"
"Excelente calidad, de escucha muy bien y se conecta fácilmente"
Ok
Esta bien 👍 funcionan y le dura mucho la carga
Los auriculares demasiado buenos. Dura muchísimo la carga y se escuchan perfecto lo recomiendo 100%
Excelentes audífonos con calidad y precio.
El sonido no es muy alto
Me encantan
"Buen sonido pero sobre todo se conecta rápido, lo que no me gusta es que no hay como subir o bajar el volumen"
"Producto excelente, calidad de sonido perfecto, diseño práctico, buena duración de batería.."
Cumplió con todas las espectativas
"Fast delivery, arrived without problems, but the sound is not very good. I take a plan and can't watch any movie because the sound is not good enough. Also, the Bluetooth connection has some problems, maybe a just a damaged one, but it is what it is."
Not as fancy as airpod but it's as comfortable as it.
nice
La conexión no es buena
👍
Llego en perfectas condiciones. Muy buen producto.
Excelente
"Tengo la versión Mi TW Earphones 2S, funcionan perfectamente en zoom pero si uso estos, zoom no los detecta, es decir no puedo hacer una reunión de zoom con ellos."
Is nice for this price
"The first two weeks worked fine, then it started to dropoff the connection (Bluetooth), I said fine reconnect then all of the sudden the left side gives me a beep and dies"
Después de 1 hora duelen los oídos en la parte superior por que son muy grandes
"I did not like them, they are very bad, they do not comply to be able to use them outside, and if they make a call, the other person hears a lot of noise"
"Play Video
I received my order, but unfortunately it was completely wet inside and out (((
The charger doesn’t work, so I think it will be the same with the headphones :(( still waiting them to get dry."
Plástica de muy mala calidad
Pecimo servicio
Todo en tiempo y forma
Muy bien sonido
Son muy buenos durabilidad de batería los recomiendo
Excelentes
"Buena relación, precio-calidad"
"Los audífonos son muy buenos, tienen un buen sonido y además les dura mucho la batería, se conectan rápido al teléfono (siempre y cuando esté el Bluetooth encendido) por ahora no hay nada que me disguste de ellos..."
For only call its not competitable.... Overall good
"Everything is just good but the sound is flay, no base at all."
"Se escucha perfectísimo, justo ahora estoy escuchando musica para escribir reseñas mensas,calidad de audio,el unico punto malo que solo es lujo es que aveces(no se si sea de los audífonos o las apps de musica) es muy difícil que funcione el pausado,solo saltar canciones(cuando acomodo los audífonos termino saltando música por lo sensible que es)"
"La batterie tient très bien, il se connecte facilement et le son est parfait pour le prix"
Un cadeau la personne étai ravi et adore
Very good quality
"Los probé hoy y suenan increíble, parecen los Airpods de Apple, lo recomiendo por el precio y calidad."
"za tą cenę (70 zł) 10.2023r. super. mały ping, można grać w nich"
Bra ljud men de sitter dåligt i öronen samt fungerar dåligt om du ska prata i telefon med dem
"Earbuds have great base while listening music and have better noise cancel effect which gives better hearing of other voice in efficient manner.
But some time in noising location there is bit issue while talking on call ."
"Hallo Leute. Für 14 Euro, sehr guter Sound. Nicht schlechter wie ein 100 euro ohrhörer. Mit eine bass verstärker app, wird es noch etwas besser.. dieses ist keine feek Bewertung, wie einige anderen."
"Di buona fattura
Calzano bene e non casino anche durante il running
Audio veramente buono e bassi si sentono
Come tutte queste cuffiette l audio è alto ma non troppo, dipende da quale app viene ascoltata la musica"
Cycled through quite a few prior to owning these. Absolutely love them. Great standby and in use times. Excellent audio and great portability.
Absolute disgusting.. don't buy it.. can't even connect to Xiaomi buds application..
""
"Se oye muy bien y me oyen bien aunque haya algo de ruido.
No tienen un sonido muy alto.
No tiene control de volumen pero por el precio no se puede pedir más.
La batería dura bastante aunque hago pocas llamadas, me sobra. Se cargan automáticamente al guardar en la caja. Con lo que realmente ofrece más batería extra. Llegaron en perfectas condiciones y el día estimado."
Très bon son correspond à mes attentes
"Great little headphones, probably the best bang for buck out there. Sound quality is great pop-ups will happen and let you know that your battery is running low or what your battery level is the randomly tell you this. People have been complaining about fit I don't have an issue with a fit to fit just as nicely as airpods"
"After two days of using airbuds one of them stop working with no reason and unconnected when it's working, Also microphone didn't work well on call.

Not good at all"
"Not worth the price at all! I'm very upset that I bought these ones. Drawbacks:
- doesn't fit the ear well;
- sound quality (my own voice capture) during the call is very poor;
- couldn't notice the noise cancellation;
- the charging box doesn't have battery indicator nor the light that it is actually charging (so there is no way to know whether the earphones are charging at all and what the status)."
"Me encantan
Tienen muy buen sonido y tienen buena duración"
"20 Euro , alles gut )"
"Very affordable, comfortable, nice sound, perfect mic, fir the ears nicely, and easy to carry.
Highly recommended."
"Per ora funzionano benissimi, anche se il volume è alto non si sente all'esterno."
"good sound, fine on the ear, not falling down but sometimes had issue on touch functions."
"Super Preisleistungskracher. Klingen toll, sind unkompliziert und passen bei mir super. Leider ist der Akku nicht ganz so ausdauernd wie bei meinen Anker soundcore Stöpseln, die sind auch zu empfehlen, sind aber inear. Desswegen habe ich die xiaomo-buds ausprobiert und bin total glücklich."
Bad
"A bateria, as funções e a qualidade do som é bom. Porém a reprodução de música é baixa e não é anti ruído"
"Tienen muchas cosillas criticables pero por el precio son excelentes. Sería muy injusto compararlos con productos que cuestan el triple. Al comprarlos se debe estar conciente de que tienen características acordes al precio. Para su gama son destacables. Les doy 4 estrellas porque tampoco quiero dar una impresión falsa. Ciertamente no son los más cómodos, pero no están mal, tampoco tienen la más alta calidad de audio, pero el sonido es decente tanto para escuchar como de su micrófono. La batería no es destacable pero tiene una duración estándar, a veces se desvincula uno por unos segundos pero es esporádico, o sea, esto ocurre una vez cada 10 o 15 días. A veces también los metes a su estuche pero no sé desvinculan ni apagan, tienes que entrar a tu teléfono para desconectarlos y que no se les acabe la batería. Esto también ocurre esporádicamente, quizá una vez cada 15 días, pero he tenido cuidado y ya no me ha pasado. Si los recomendaría, incluso mi esposa me ha pedido unos iguales. Creo que es un buen producto para el precio que tiene."
L’isolamento dei rumori non è ottimale ma il suono è alto e chiaro. Forse per me sono leggermente grandi perché tendono a scappare. Il sensore touch per i comandi bisogna centrarlo bene affinché funzioni. Per il resto ottimo rapporto qualità\prezzo le ricomprerei.
"These earbuds are awesome compared with others I had, these are way superior! They are very lightweight, don't fall from my ears like others, have a very good external noise reduction, and sound is crisp and clear."
"These $47 earbuds sound better, have better active noise cancellation and are all around so much better than the $249.99 earbuds I bought have a touchscreen case (that I shall not mention the name because I am still a huge supporter of of this company). I'm a sound engineer (for live sound) so when I want to put in earbuds I want them to be the best. And so far these are it for me. Though you can not get the app in America so to access all the features, it doesn't matter. Redmi (English version) earbuds are where it's at.
..... Side note. I live in America, however I do have the supportive app because I have a VPN from Thailand.
But like I said, it doesn't really matter if you can get the supportive app or not. I still give the 7 out of 5 stars (yes, I know what I did there)."
"Bought this for my wife as a gift, she likes the Xiaomi buds line, the sound quality is very good for what you are paying for, material quality feels good on touch, I personally like the case, they are easy to set up, even tho the buds app is region locked where I live (Central America) we had no issues connecting to BT and controlling them from there, best bang for your buck, performance is good too."
"Se escucha a la perfección, pero no es compatible con otra marca de celular"
"Los compré para hacer deporte y han sido muy utiles, su ANC no es muy invasivo pero tampoco permite que entren sonidos externos. La batería es excelente y sus funciones tactiles me gustaron mucho, lo unico ""malo"" es que las medidas de los tapones de auricular no son estandar y me quedan sueltos los S pero los M ya son incómodos (cosa que no pasa con sony, jbl, etc) pero para el precio, vale un montón. Productazo."
"Funciona muy bien, recomendados"
The app doesn't work in usa
"the noise cancellation does not really work. can still hear the noise regardless of the noise cancellation settings. the noise cancellation is much worse compared to the xiaomi bud 3 pro (35db)
By default, the ear bud cannot connect to two devices. you have to download the xiaomi app to change that.
The battery life is also shorter than xiaomi bud 3 pro."
"Lo compré hace unos meses y puedo decir que hasta ahora nunca se me han descargado por completo, ni la caja ni los auriculares, dándole un uso normal a diario de entre 6-8 horas y tal vez más, cargan super rápido, tienen unos buenos bajos y su sonido es super bueno, la cancelación de ruido está decente por lo que pagas, escuchando música no escuchas nada cuando está activa,

Puntos malos
El estuche es un poco sensible a rayones y golpes(mucho a rayones, tengo la versión en negro por cierto) y la tapa del estuche parece un poco sensible y a veces es incómodo de abrir por como es pero para nada es molesto.

El audio 360 o espacial hace falta en estos audífonos, es la única pega que les encuentro."
"La cancelación es buena pero no demasiado, tengo un canal auditivo pequeño por lo qué tengo que usar las almohadillas talla S, con la talla M la cancelación es mucho mejor pero me empezaban a incomodar después de algunos minutos, al punto de doler, los audífonos no se salen de los oídos, se cargan rápido en el estuche y tienen buen sonido, el sonido en los juegos no tiene retraso, valen la pena"
"So I've had this for 2 months and at 1 month in, the case broke. The buds sound fine but when contacting support, they couldn't help me.

The buds still charge but remain connected in the case, not to mention auto connects when I manually disconnect them. Sometimes my audio randomly goes out even with another device being used.

Won't be getting another if I'm not gonna get support."
"Cute buds, promising bunch of reviews that lead you to believe this could be the GOAT pair of buds. They arrived, I charged them, then... they failed. No app connection, regardless of device type .

Would not connect to a phone.

Would not connect to a tablet.

5 DACs...no connection.

7 laptops...nope.

If the device can't carryout a fundamental action by which it's functionality is enabled, I can't be bothered to invest time into hours of problem solving.

Sadly ,these were returned and I'll be a hard pass for other by xiaomi as well."
I just purchased this as a gift for my father and we were very disappointed to find out that the sound was very mediocre at its best. I do not recommend this whatsoever. Look somewhere else
Muy útil
"Gli Xiaomi Redmi Buds 5 offrono un eccellente rapporto qualità-prezzo. Il design è elegante e comodo, con auricolari che si adattano bene all'orecchio senza causare fastidi anche dopo lunghe sessioni di ascolto. La qualità del suono è notevole per la fascia di prezzo, con bassi profondi e alti chiari che rendono l'ascolto piacevole in vari generi musicali.

Le funzioni di cancellazione del rumore passivo sono efficaci nel ridurre le distrazioni ambientali, e la durata della batteria è buona, assicurando diverse ore di utilizzo con una singola carica. La connessione Bluetooth è stabile e il pairing è veloce e semplice con i dispositivi.

In sintesi, gli Xiaomi Redmi Buds 5 sono una scelta eccellente per chi cerca auricolari wireless di qualità senza spendere troppo. Offrono comfort, buona qualità del suono e prestazioni affidabili. Consigliati per chi cerca un'opzione economica ma performante."
Quality of sound 👌. Noice cancellation also too good
Mikrofonen är mkt bra. Klart bra ljud. Även i bullrigare miljö fungerar dom bra. Pratar du mkt med handsfree köp dessa. Bättre än genomsnittet även de som kostar 1000kr mer
"Confesso que a qualidade de sincronização não é a das melhores, apresenta falhas em alguns momentos. Não sei se é devido a qualidade da operadora no Brasil ou ao fone em si. Bateria de longa duração, acabamento Premium e um bom custo benefício. Um ponto negativo além da falha na conexão as vezes, com pequenas travadas ou oscilações no som é que a caixa que acompanha o aparelho é extremamente frágil e fina. O manuseio deve ser cuidadoso inclusive ao abrir para não estragar a caixinha. Mas acredito que seja uma boa compra no final."
"Como alguien que ha probado varios auriculares en este rango de precios (¡y algunos incluso más caros!), puedo decir con total confianza que los Redmi Buds 5 son la mejor opción. La cancelación de ruido es increíble, la batería aguanta genial, y son supercómodos, se sienten muy cómodos en los oídos y puedes usarlos durante horas sin molestias.
Sólo les pondría un pero: les falta carga inalámbrica, pero sinceramente, por este precio, la calidad de sonido y la comodidad compensan con creces el ""pero"".

Si buscas calidad, funcionalidad y un precio contenido ¡no busques más! ¡Muy recomendables! 💙🎧"
"Quería algo barato y que no fuera muy malo. Calidad de audio buena, el control gestual muy sencillo y funciona bien cuando te habituas, la duración de la batería muy buena, hago paseos de horas con el perro y siempre vuelvo con bateria, la caja donde guardarlos muy compacta y sólida.
La verdad es que no tengo nada negativo después de llevar usándolo semanas."
"Ich brauchte dringend neue Kopfhörer und mein Mann hat diese beim surfen entdeckt. Passend zum Handy. Die Farbe ist sehr schön. Der Klang ist top. Die Verbindung und Einrichtung gingen sehr schnell und leicht von der Hand.
Ich höre viel Hörbücher und dafür sind die Kopfhörer einfach klasse. Sie sitzen gut im Ohr, man kann festlegen, wie viel man von der Umwelt mitbekommen möchte, der Klang ist sehr gut.
Für den Preis sind es sehr gute Kopfhörer, die Akkulaufzeit ist auch sehr gut.
Mir gefallen sie sehr gut. Ich würde sie wieder kaufen."
"Facile à utiliser avec mon téléphone ou pour le boulot. Ergonomiques et offrant un très bon son.
Ravie de cet achat"
"Got them for less than a month and work perfect up to now! Easy pairing with my Xiaomi phone and other devices (push the button on the right side, see photo). I didn't check exactly battery life to justify specs, but together with the case it will not trouble you. I experience some uneven discharging, but this is not really a problem.
Listening quality is very good, you don't need to raise the volume too much, and the bass is quite good. The active noise cancellation is really magical! You can hear your music or watch a movie even in aeroplane, without external noise! If you buy earbuds this is a feature you definitely need! Also transparency mode works quite well.
Bluetooth range is quite good, you can move in the house from room to room, within a logical distance, and still stay connected. In open space the range is well above 10 m.
The mic quality seems to be ok, nobody has complained to me so far 😉
Overall that's a good buy and I'm quite happy!"
"Son muy cómodos , la cancelación de ruido es decente para el precio, el sonido es muy buena , el estuche es muy bonito y los audífonos ni que se diga, los he tenido casi 5-6 horas seguidos y no me han molestado."
It’s incredibly clear sound and a very long time to play good battery on the device
良かったです
"عشان نفهم الدنيا خلينا نقسم الموضوع

اول نقطة وهي عزل الضوضاء :
و انا هنا بتكلم على عزل الضوضاء من غير ما تشغل موسيقى اساسا عزل الضوضاء جيد و مقبول جدا بالنسبالي و متتوقعش منه انه يلغي كل الاصوات اللي حواليك بالكامل لأن درجة العزل زي دي اساسا ممكن متكونش موجودة في سماعات بضعف السعر او اكتر
ولكن في المجمل هي بتقلل الضوضاء اللي واصلالك بقدر ملحوظ بيسمحلك انك تنعزل تماما عن العالم لو شغلت حاجة على درجة صوت بسيطة
بالتالي انت مش محتاج تعلي الصوت للآخر عشان تنعزل تماما بالكتير هترفعه لدرجة متوسطة في اغلب الاحيان
و ده في حد ذاته بيتيح ليك لو في مواصلات او غيره تشغل قرآنك او البود كاست بتاعك او الكتاب الصوتي اللي بتحبه براحتك و بدون ما تصدع من الصوت
في المجمل ياخد ٧/١٠ في درجة العزل

جودة الصوت :
الصوت جيد بشكل عام متوازن و مش هيزعلك ولو حاسس انه محتاج يتعدل زي مثلا يزيد البيز او التريبلز يتحسن فا فيه في الابلكيشن بتاعها ٤ بروفايلات صوت تقدر تختار اللي يريحك فيهم بس انا شخصيا بستخدمها على الستاندرد و احيانا وقت جيم او غيره بقوم غيره للبيز وبتاع
نديله 9/10

مقاومة الماء و الاتربة :
السماعات نفسها فيها IP54
و دي مقاومة لرزاز المية و الاتربة بس موضوع العرق بقا الله اعلم بجد مش عارف و البوكس نفسه طبعا مش مضاد لأي حاجة

السماعة :
السماعة خفيفة جدا الصراحة مش هتضايق ودنك في الاستعمال المطول و الخامات اللي مصنوعة منها جيدة

البطارية :
البطارية انا مضغطتش عليها الى الان بس شاومي بتوعدك لو قفلت عزل الضوضاء ممكن توصل معاك ل ٤٠ ساعة بالعلبة بتاعتها😂
بس الجميل بجد حوار الشحن السريع للسماعتين يعني انت يا باشا استخدم براحتك ولو خلصت منك البطارية الموضوع بسيط شيل السماعة في العلبة ٥ دقايق و هي هتشيلك ساعتين ردا للواجب 😂

المايك : كويس في المكالمات يعني الصوت بيبقا مضغوط شوية في الزحمة ولكنه في الاخر مسموع بشكل كويس اما في الريكوردات زي ريكوردات الوتس فا هي بيبقا فيها دوشة و الصوت بيبقى مش واضح يمكن مشكله في الوتس او مشكلة ممكن تتحل بابديت للسماعة
في المجمل ياخد 8/10

العلبة :
البوكس مصنوع من بلاستيك مطفي جيد و مش بيبصم
سماكة الغطا بتاع البوكس الصراحة يرقى لسماكة غطا علبة مناديل مبلله مش علبة سماعة (هو مش نحيف للدرجادي بس اديني بتريق) ولكن هو مش ضعيف للدرجة الصراحة + كونه مش سميك مخلي العلبة حجمها صغير و دي حاجة عجباني جدا الصراحة و بكده تقدر تاخد السماعة في اي حته معاك بسهوله
و تصميم العلبة نفسه هيخليها معرضة للأتربة اكتر بس بردو يظل تنضيفها اسهل بكتير من العلب التانية يعني على المدى البعيد لما تيجي تنضفها مش هتحتاج كيت تنضيف السماعات ام ١٠٠ جنية ولا حاجة كل اللي انت محتاجه هو منديل بس و شكرا
مغناطيس تثبيت السماعة في العلبة متوسط القوة بمعنى انه كافي انه يمسك السماعة و يثبتها لو العلبة مفتوحه و قلبتها و هزيتها شوية مثلا ولكن بالرغم من كده مش هيضايقك و انت بتطلع السماعة

ميزات اضافية :
معاك ميزة ان السماعة بتتعرف ان كانت في ودنك ولا لا بالتللي بتوقف التراك او اي حاجة بتسمعها لو شلت فردة من ودنك
عندك كمان ميزة انك تقدر توصلها بجهازين في ذات الوقت
الترانسبيرنسي مود شغال كويس الصراحة مش بيحول الصوت لروبوت او يغيره بالسلب زي بعض السماعات في ذات الفئة
السماعة بتدعم جوجل فاست بير يعني من الاخر كده بمجرد ما هتفتح علبة للسماعة هتتوصل بالموب مباشرة و دي ميزة روشة مش اي حد يقدرها خد بالك
الابلكيشن بيبين نسبة الشحن في العلبة و السماعتين
التحكم باللمس دقيق و مش هيزعلك

بس كده ياعم في المجمل السماعة تاخد
8/10
من ناحية القيمة و الميزات اللي بتقدمها مقابل السعر ولو جايبها بعرض كويس يبقا 10/10 مستريح
بس كده يارب اكون فيدتك ولو فيه اي تعليقات او تغيرات في التجربة هعدل الريفيو ده و سلام"
"Audífonos súper económicos, pero con gran calidad en el audio, cómodos, les dura muchísimo la batería, varias opciones de configuración. Funcionan perfecto!"
Nice
"Honnêtement très surpris par la qualité globale, et j'ai des airpods pro aussi.
Certes on est pas au niveau de finition d'un boitier apple, mais franchement le delta de prix me laisse songeur. Très bonne qualité des conversations au téléphone, et son assez enveloppant, surtout en utilisant l'application redmi qui va avec, et qui permet d'optimiser les basses. L'annulation du bruit ambiant est assez efficace, sans aller jusque les top du marché, mais très franchement ca vaut vraiment le coup, l'autonomie est aussi au rendez vous, elle est tres bonne même. Le son est suffisamment puissant pour être das sa bulle.
Vraiment très bien pour le prix !"
"These are awesome ! I use it with my poco x6 and i have a great experience with these, Active Noise Cancelation and Transparency mode are perfect for me, it have a very good quality sound and a very good battery life ! You can adjust bass or voices etc. with it. So if you look on a redmi buds with lot of features and does bot cost that munch , well this is for you ! Purple color look just amazing and very clean ! It is compatiblr with google fast pair which connects these on less than 7 sec."
Got these as a replacement for my JBL Tune 235 NC TWS of which the batteries died and they surpassed my expectations. I think I actually prefer the audio these Redmi 5's produce.
"Nach langem Überlegen und dem Vergleich verschiedener Modelle habe ich mich für die Xiaomi Redmi Buds 5 in der Farbe Schwarz entschieden. Der Preis von etwa 30 Euro schien mir sehr vernünftig, vor allem wenn man die versprochenen Features wie das Active Noise Cancelling und die gute Klangqualität berücksichtigt.

Als ich die Kopfhörer zum ersten Mal auspackte, fiel mir sofort das schlichte, aber elegante Design auf. Die Kopfhörer sind leicht und fühlen sich angenehm in den Ohren an. Das Tragen über mehrere Stunden hinweg war kein Problem, und sie blieben auch während meiner Joggingrunden fest im Ohr.

Die Einrichtung war dank der Xiaomi-Buds-App ein Kinderspiel. Die App präsentierte alle wichtigen Funktionen übersichtlich auf dem Hauptbildschirm, und ich konnte die Touchfunktionen so anpassen, dass versehentliche Berührungen vermieden wurden.

Die Klangqualität hat mich positiv überrascht. Die Bässe sind kräftig und die Höhen klar. Auch wenn die Klangregelung auf vier Voreinstellungen begrenzt ist, fand ich eine Einstellung, die meinen Musikgeschmack traf.

Das ANC ist besonders im Bassbereich effektiv und dämpft Umgebungsgeräusche um bis zu 30 dB. Zwar erreicht es nicht die vom Hersteller angegebenen 46 dB, aber für meinen Alltag in der Stadt war es mehr als ausreichend, um mich auf meine Musik konzentrieren zu können.

Ein kleiner Nachteil ist die fehlende Unterstützung für HD-Codecs wie aptX HD oder LDAC. Für Audiophile könnte das ein Kritikpunkt sein, aber für meinen täglichen Gebrauch und das Streamen von Musik über mein Smartphone war die Qualität absolut zufriedenstellend.

Die Akkulaufzeit ist beeindruckend. Ich komme locker durch den Tag, ohne nachladen zu müssen, und das Ladeetui bietet zusätzliche Ladungen, was besonders auf Reisen praktisch ist.

Insgesamt bin ich mit den Xiaomi Redmi Buds 5 sehr zufrieden. Sie bieten ein ausgezeichnetes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis, eine solide Leistung und sind eine gute Wahl für alle, die auf der Suche nach zuverlässigen und erschwinglichen ANC-Kopfhörern sind."
Not great sound quality. They arrived with some scratches
Habe nichts zu beanstanden. Gute Qualität zu einem fairen Preis
"Muy buena calidad precio, tiene buena cancelación de ruido y buenos bajos para el precio, no hubo ningún problema con el envío y buena batería"
"Recientemente adquirí los Xiaomi Redmi Buds 5 y no puedo estar más satisfecho con mi compra. Desde el momento en que los saqué de la caja, estos auriculares han superado todas mis expectativas.

Calidad de sonido: La calidad de sonido es simplemente espectacular. Los bajos son profundos, los medios claros y los agudos nítidos. Escuchar música con estos auriculares es una experiencia inmersiva que te hace disfrutar cada nota.

Comodidad: Son extremadamente cómodos. Puedo llevarlos durante horas sin sentir ninguna molestia. Vienen con varios tamaños de almohadillas para asegurar un ajuste perfecto y seguro.

Duración de la batería: La duración de la batería es impresionante. Puedo usarlos durante todo el día sin necesidad de cargarlos. Además, el estuche de carga es compacto y ofrece varias cargas adicionales, lo cual es muy conveniente para los viajes.

Conectividad: La conexión Bluetooth es estable y rápida. No he experimentado cortes ni retrasos en la conexión, incluso al alejarme del dispositivo emparejado.

Funciones adicionales: Los controles táctiles son intuitivos y responden bien. Además, tienen cancelación de ruido, lo que mejora aún más la experiencia de uso en entornos ruidosos.

Relación calidad-precio: En resumen, los Xiaomi Redmi Buds 5 ofrecen una relación calidad-precio inigualable. Por un precio muy razonable, obtienes auriculares de alta calidad con características que solo se encuentran en productos mucho más caros.

Recomiendo encarecidamente los Xiaomi Redmi Buds 5 a cualquier persona que busque auriculares inalámbricos de gran calidad sin gastar una fortuna. ¡No te arrepentirás!"
"Best thing is the long lasting battery.

I haven't been able to install the software to handle it from my phone so that is the down bit. It won't let me handle the earbuds from my phone although I can pair it, strange..."
"If you want something that feels like it fits without compromise this is for you, audio is spot on and everything works like it should . Recommended product"
Telefon
"Har använt dem i 1 vecka, små och smidiga med en stor mängd olika funktioner, bra batteritid, och äntligen ett par lurar som passar mina små öron"
What i like most with those pods are really good battery time and fast charging. I had more expensive buds that annoyed me a lot when I was running and when the buds got a bit water the music changes by itself. With those buds no problem and really good water resistant. The sound is pretty good for the price.
"Je suis ravie de mon achat , le bruit est sacrément atténué , la qualité son est top , c'est vraiment net.
Rapport qualité prix imbattable . Je recommande +++"
La cancelación de sonido es muy buena para el precio. La calidad del audio no esta mal a mi gusto le falta mas definición sobre todo en graves pero por el precio son muy buenos. Algo que no sabía es que traen varios cojines para los oídos y se agradece. Fácil de configurar.
"No soy una persona habitual de usar audífonos o amante del audio espectacular, pero estos me sorprendieron bastante funcionan increíble la cancelación de ruido es excelente, el sonido es bastante bueno los uso a una cuarta parte, duran bastante, sin duda los volvería a comprar"
"Ich benutze sonst AirPods Pro und auch Pro Max habe zahlreiche hochwertige Kopfhörer für allerlei Gelegenheiten vergleichend kann ich sagen - die Dinger sind top. Der Sound ist gut. Ich würde von einem ausgeglichen leicht basslastigem Sound sprechen - die Akkulaufzeit ist top. Haptisch ein sehr gutes Produkte - das Case verschwindet wunderbar in der Tasche und die Dinger stören wirklich nicht. Einzig das Aufklappen beim Case könnte etwas hochwertiger gemacht sein. Man muss allerdings sagen, dass der Öffnungsmechanismus an sich wirklich gut gemacht ist. Er fühlt sich nur komisch da da die Deckplatte des Case sehr dünn gearbeitet ist. Gute Akkulaufzeit und ein mäßig ansetzendes des Noise Canceling, das für den Alltag ohne weitere ausreicht. Insgesamt ein Kopfhörer mit einem unschlagbaren Preis-Leistungsverhältnis der genau so gut im Ohr sitzt wie ein Air Pod Pro und in Sachen Sound fast mithalten kann. Von mir klare Kaufempfehlung."
"Suena genial, muy cómodos, se vinculan perfectamente y con la aplicación xiaomi buds puedes configurar cantidad de parámetros.
Tengo problemas al vincularlo con el Bluetooth del ordenador con w10 pero creo q es problema del S. O."
"・ノイキャン性能：パソコンのファンやエアコンの音を効果的にカット
・音質：はっきりとした音で満足度が高い
・使いやすさ：PCに接続してもイヤホン操作でノイキャン可能
・人の声：8割ほど聞こえるため、会話にも支障なし

46dBの音がどれぐらいの大きさかはわからないが実際に使ってみると、パソコンのファンやエアコンの音がほぼ聞こえなくなり、静かな環境を作り出せました。音質もはっきりしていて、聴いていて満足感があります。PCに接続しても右側のイヤホンを長押しするだけでノイキャンモードになるので、とても便利です。人の声は8割ほど聞こえるため、必要な会話も聞き逃しません。ノイキャン機能と使いやすさのバランスが取れた、おすすめのイヤホンです。"
Good battery life
Great value for money. Good sound.
Man kann nicht meckern. Um den Preis! Sound ist super! Und das Voice Canceling funktioniert auch super wenn man laut Musik hört. Sie halten auch wunderbar in den Ohren.
"Battery life 5/5
(Excellent longevity and charging speed)
Sound Quality 4/5
(Pretty decent drivers for playback, calls are clear but meh)
Noise cancelation 3/5
(Not perfect for a noisy wok environment etc)
Materials used 4/5
(Cheap plastic but not bad)
Suitability for all ear sizes 3/5
(Painful for small ears)

Overall:

"Calidad Precio, me gustaron muchos, para un uso diario están excelentes, son cómodos, faciles de emparejar, buen sonido."
"Destacan por su impresionante calidad de sonido, tiene unos graves profundos y agudos claros. La reducción de ruido activa es eficaz en ambientes ruidosos como aviones o metros, permitiéndome disfrutar de un espacio personal silencioso.

El diseño es ergonómico y cómodo. La batería es otro punto fuerte: hasta 10 horas de uso continuo, extendiéndose a 40 horas con el estuche de carga. La aplicación ofrece un control total de los cascos.

Los tres modos de transparencia son prácticos para estar al tanto del entorno mientras disfrutas de tu música. En resumen, los Redmi Buds 5 combinan excelente calidad de sonido, comodidad y funcionalidad avanzada, siendo una opción sólida para usuarios exigentes."
"Premessa, parliamo di auricolari bluetooth sotto i 40€ di prezzo. Mi aspettano qualcosa di un po' cheap. Invece.
1) Qualità audio
La musica è molto definita, i bassi presenti si fanno notare quando serve. Siamo sulla stessa qualità audio degli apple air buds. Sorprendente. Ottimi con i film. Il volume al massimo non è elevatissimo, ma questo credo dipenda dal mio telefoni Redmi (lo fa con tutti gli auricolari...). Anche al massimo nessuna distorsione.
Soppressione del rumore ambientale buona.
2) Facilità di installazione ed utilizzo
Si scarica l'app dedicata ed è tutto fatto. App di veramente semplice utilizzo.
Quando si estraggono dalla scatolina non fai tempo praticamente ad infilarli che sono già collegati.
La gestione del touch reattiva, mi sarebbe piaciuto un feedback sonoro.
3) Autonomia.
Dopo 2 ore di film batteria scesa del 10%, quindi la giornata di lavoro è assolutamente garantita.
Dal 30% a carica completa tramite scatolina in circa mezz'ora. Notifiche a display del cellulare. Rimane un mistero sul motivo per cui l'auricolare destro consuma leggermente di più
4) Rifinitura e materiali.
L'auricolare è perfetto. Dovessi fare il pignolo, la scatolina si apre solo con l'unghia, avrei preferito una sede più ampia per infilare il dito o un'apertura a pulsante. Auricolari tenuti perfettamente in sede tramite magneti . Led Esterno della scatola ad indicare la ricarica appena visibile.
Che dire di altro? sono estremamente soddisfatto"
"Muito bom o áudio, alto e excelente, com um microfone perfeito e um ótimo cancelamento de ruído."
Écouteurs très jolis. Beau design la boîte est originale comment elle s’ouvre. Je suis contente de mon achat. Réducteur de bruit
"bon son, bonne autonomie, s adapte facilement pour de petites oreilles…"
Nice
"Je suis agréablement surpris se la qualité du son, l'installation est simple et rapide avec l'application.
je les recommande."
Calidad precio 100% integración rápido con cualquier dispositivo tanto android como iOS y un sonido excelente
"Har tidigare köp liknade lurar. Aldrig riktigt känt mig bekväm med dessa.
Dessa Redmi Buds 5 blev en annan upplevelse.
Funkar perfekt. Sitter säkert i öronen. Riktigt bra ljud. Rätt pris.
En angenäm upplevelse. Rekommenderas!"
"I was convinced to try these buds after seeing the review on Mobil.se rating it at 8/10 (these guys never give out 10/10 so anything above a 7 is enough to catch my interest)

And I honestly feel they they undersold them. These are better than any buds I've ever used in my life which considering their price makes me feel that I've been ripped off in the past.

To be fair the anc only works if you twist the buds all the way in, the app sometimes loses the connection to the buds/case and the lack of water resistance makes me a little nervous. But that pales in the face that

*The connection is awesome
*The battery life is at least ten hours and they recharge fast
*The case and buds don't look like much but they do their work, so you don't feel like you're paying for unnecessary design
*The sound is nice and crisp, and the call quality is very high on both ends (albeit the background noise does bleed into the call on the other side)
*The controller works a lot better than most buds I've tried as the area of it is a lot smaller than usual.

9/10, just hampered by the lack of water resistance rating."
"Telefon da kullanıyorum. Ses kalitesi, pil ömrü, ergonomi gerçekten çok güzel."
"Buen sonido, cómodos, la cancelación activa para sonidos tipo motor de avión, A/A perfecta. Se conecta y desconecta del iPhone muy bien. La verdad que muy buenos por el precio"
"Ótimo produto, funciona maravilhosamente bem"
Die Kopfhörer sind bequem und sehr leicht. Die fühlen sich gut an und der Sound ist sehr gut 👍.
"Produit efficace, mieux que les bud 4."
"Los audífonos son muy buenos para el precio, si cancelan el ruido y son muy bonitos. Le doy 4 estrellas por qué a veces tienen errores pequeños que sin molestos como interferencia, no es un problema si no eres quisquilloso, los recomiendo."
Xiaomi telefonumla kullanıyorum. Uygulamasından ses kalitesini arttırınca normal seviyeye geliyor fakat bilgisayar ile kullanırken ses o kadar iyi gelmiyor. Koşu sırasında kulakta durmuyor sanki düşecekmiş gibi oluyor ama yürüyüş veya ağırlık kaldırma gibi durumlarda kulağınızdan düşmez.
"J'ai acheté ces écouteurs pour remplacer mes anciens Mi True Wireless Basic 2. Je suis très satisfait, cependant, même si la qualité sonore est très bonne, j'ai remarqué un léger manque de clarté dans les aigus, la puissance est un peu plus faible que mes anciens écouteurs.
Ils sont très confortables et tiennent bien dans les oreilles (mes anciennes tombaient sans cesse), j'ai courru avec sans problème, mais attention à l'excès de transpiration qui pourrait l'endommager (écrit sur le site de Xiaomi). Le boitier est très propre et rentre facilement dans la poche. Par contre, elle glisse un peu. L'USB type C est très apprécié. Les aimants qui servent à fixer les écouteurs sont puissants.
Du coté de l'ANC, je n'entends plus ma soeur bavarde ce qui est une bonne chose. Efficace dans un métro moyennement bruyant et dans la rue. Il y'a aussi un mode transparent, efficace pour entendre ma soeur me parler si sa voix me manque.
Conclusion: Très bon choix et très satisfait. Je préfère un peu plus la qualité sonore de mes anciens écouteurs pour la puissance mais ceux là sont aussi très bon,mais manque de clarté pour les aigus."
期待して購入しましたがノイズキャンセラ機能がそれほどでもない。電車のノイズがしっかり入る。
"Buon prodotto. Configurazione facile, assistita dall'applicazione semplice ed intuitiva; associazione Bluetooth praticamente istantanea, suono pieno e corposo, durata della batteria sufficiente, il tutto ad un prezzo assolutamente accessibile.
Unica nota negativa, non ho capito bene la funzionalità della cancellazione del rumore. Attivata o meno, non noto alcuna differenza. Per questo motivo una stella in meno.
A mio avviso, è un prodotto assolutamente consigliato se non si pretendono sonorità ""SUPER""... ma a quel punto, anche il prezzo sarà ""SUPER"""
"Por lo que cuestan no hay mejor compra. Bonitos, buena fabricacion, buen sonido, comodos, conectividad excelente tanto con el iphone como con su propia aplicacion.
La cancelacion de ruido es mas marketing que otra cosa porque no hace nada. Pero por lo que cuestan tampoco me esperaba que funcionara.
Muy recomendables."
"Por el precio están muy bien ,además son muy bonitos ,los e usado para correr y todo bien ,la cancelación de ruido esta muy bien,sonido bueno ,en general vale completamente la pena."
"Bonne qualité de connectivité, de batterie, sonore et insertion oreille. C'est le top !"
Passen angenehm ins Ohr. Viele Einstellungen. Guter Klang.
Die Lieferung war sehr schnell. Das Produkt ist von guter Qualität und entspricht den Anforderungen in dieser Preiskategorie. Sie sind ziemlich bequem und fallen nicht aus den Ohren.
Very good
"Fácil de vincular, la batería es duradera y se oyen muy bien"
"Anteriormente tenía los Buds 4 lite y al ver que estaban estos pues decidí a comprármelos, la verdad si están mucho más bonitos, estéticamente y al tener gomas no lastiman los oídos a comparación de los 4 lite que tenia. Además el color blue sky les da una estética de 10, la batería si es duradera, llevo un viaje de 5 hrs y solo se ha gastado el 25% de la batería, además su cancelación de ruido es bueno. Yo los recomiendo al 100"
"C'est mon 1.er achat d'earsbuds. et j'en suis hyper contente. Le son est génial, ils restent chargés longtemps."
"Bra batteritid, lätta att parkoppla med mobil, rätt bra ljud och bas. Går rätt snabbt att ladda etuiet."
Prisvärda
Yaklaşık 3 haftadır aktif olarak kullanıyorum ve gayet memnunum. Ses kalitesi oldukça iyi.

ال noise cancelling ممتاز بالنسبه للسعر بردو"
"Piccola introduzione. Ho comprato queste cuffie dopo il terzo paio di AirPods 2 che mi hanno dato problemi di batteria e disconnessioni. Ho pensato di prendere le AirPods Pro 2 ma ho avuto qualche riluttanza per il prezzo. Fatalità credo siano uscite da pochissimo queste qui. Prezzo di listino 40 euro e a tanto le ho prese da Amazon. La mia speranze era che la soppressione dei suoni mi isolasse totalmente, almeno in aereo. Sono arrivate stamattina quindi non ho ancora provato in aereo ma nei prossimi mesi spero di aggiornare la recensione.

Ho scelto quelle nere e sono molto belle. Quelle bianche dai video in rete mi sembravano proprio brutte.

All’orecchio le ho trovate ben salde e molto comode ma vanno inserite correttamente ruotandola finché non trovate l’inclinazione giusta.

Appena inserite si è attivata la soppressione dei suoni in automatico (ulteriori sistemazioni vanno fatte con la app). La soppressione funziona molto bene sulle basse e medie frequenze, ma sulle alte zero. Non attenua nulla. Ciò significa che se una persona parla o la tv è accesa la sentite, ma come se il suono fosse emesso da delle cuffiette ad altissimo volume.

Ho provato ad accendere l’asciugacapelli e si sentiva solo la parte acuta del suono attenuando quindi molto il rumore. Con il rumore della caldaia, della lavatrice, del subwoofer della Soundbar invece i suoni vengono totalmente eliminati. In teoria, se tanto mi dà tanto, in aereo non sentirò il rumore dei motori ma se dovesse piangere qualche bambino invece quello sì.

Dentro la app si può modificare il tocco, doppio tocco e triplo tocco degli auricolari destro e sinistro in modo separato. Poi è possibile scegliere la modalità trasparenza, spento o isolamento. La modalità trasparenza o spento mi sembra uguale. O con minuscola differenza.
Sempre dalla app si può scegliere se collegare contemporaneamente due dispositivi alle cuffie, o se risaltare i bassi, la voce, gli acuti.

Il bussolotto per riporre le cuffie onestamente lo trovo brutto esteticamente e anche al tocco, la parte lucida graffiata in meno di un’ora letteralmente e quando ripongo le cuffie non fanno mai a posto in modo preciso da sole, ci devo perdere tempo. Avrò problemi io… ma boh. Mai successo con altre.

Rispetto alle oppo encore buds lite (non ricordo il nome preciso) si sentono tanto meglio, calzano meglio e isola infinitamente di più. Non c’è paragone proprio, valgono almeno quei 15 euro in più del prezzo.

Acquisto quindi promosso già per 40 euro, ma se le trovaste a meno sarebbe il top.
Infine non ho provato la telefonata quindi aggiornerò anche per quello. Enjoy"
"Överträffade förväntningarna på allt.
Bra ljud, brusreducering och batteritid.
Kan jämföras med betydligt dyrare pods.
Mycket prisvärda, rekommenderas"
"Très bon produit, prix hyper raisonnable, je recommande 👌🏾"
"Tuve los Buds3 Lite, y estos son una muy buena mejora, bloquea ruido exterior tanto para escuchar como para hablar por el mic. Han mejorado mucho en forma y comodidad. Recomiendo."

"2eme paire acheté, qualité son, finition, autonomie génial."
"Jabra ハンズフリーを洗濯してしまいハンズフリーイヤボンを探していました。
価格的にもJabra とさほど変わらない事やXiaomiはスマホメーカーでもあり集音マイクに品質は良いと思い購入しました。
仕事で電話してもこちら音声もしっかり聞き取れるようで安心して使えています。
自動接続、片耳使用、ノイズキャンセルと外音取り込み機能など満足するものです。
イヤホンとして音質は価格以上の物はあると思います。"
"Le son est très bon. Par contre, je trouve que la fonction tactile est perfectible mais fonctionne quand même.

Pour moi ca reste un bon rapport qualité prix."
"Efter att ha läst och kollat på ett flertal recensioner var jag tvungen att testa dem själv, och ja det är riktigt imponerande vad man får för pengarna. Det enda som egentligen skvallrar om att det rör sig om ett par billigare lurar är fodralet och avsaknaden av vattentäthet. Men med tanken på priset är även det svårt att gnälla på. Byt dina Airpods mot dessa och du kommer inte bli besviken.

"Por ese precio, no hay audífonos mejor balanceados. La calidad de audio es muy buena, su cancelación de ruido de verdad se siente y la app resulta muy útil. 10/10"
"Funcionan perfectamente, se emparejan rápido y son cómodos.El sonido por este precio es bueno.Yo los cogí en color verde azulado y son muy chulos."
"Xiaomi siempre cumple
Precio calidad"
Parecen ser muy sencillos pero la verdad es todo lo contrario es buen material y el sonido suena muy bueno con la App
"ich habe die buds 5 zurückgesendet, aber nicht aus qualitativen gründen sondern weil ich gemerkt hab voll in-ears halten bei mir einfach nie und ich glaub langsam es liegt an meinen ohren.

die soundqualität ist super für 35€. der trage komfort und die passform der hörer an sich sind das beste daran! das womit ich persönlich nicht klarkomm is sind in-ear silikon tips, im restlichen ohr hält der perfekt. schade ist, dass man nur 3 equalizer einstellungen hat, einen custom eq in die app zu bauen wär nur logisch. anc ging bei mir nur wenn ich sie mit der hand reingedrückt hab und festgehalten hab gut, aber für jemanden der keine probleme mit inear tips hat sind die kopfhörer mit die besten."
"I don't go out of my way to leave a lot of reviews. But I figured I was so impressed with these that I would go ahead and leave a review. I purchased these a few days ago and I'm extremely pleased with the whole experience. Let me tell you the reasons why. I have something that you might describe as a shopping addiction lol. When I'm looking to purchase something, I will spend hours looking at every option before I finally pull the trigger. It was no different with this purchase. When going online and looking for earbuds that are less than $30, there are hundreds of choices. Most of them have great reviews and seem to be made pretty well. What sets these apart from the others are some pretty cool features.

First, these will work with Siri through the earbud itself and not through the cell phone. Most inexpensive earbuds only work with Siri if you click it four times which is very difficult to do. These will work just like your airpods work. Which for me, is really cool since I used these for biking. I don't have to be clicking anything 4 times to skip songs or to play something different. And before anybody starts, I only put one in my right ear at a low level so I can hear traffic coming lol.

They definitely hold the charge well. Which is good, because it's a pain in the neck for cheaper earbuds to have to be charging them every time you use them for a few hours. Also, the sound quality is absolutely amazing for the money. I have about four or five different sets of earbuds and one of them is an Apple Airpod. I don't know which generation. But I do know that these sound a little better than all of them. If you like deep bace and Crystal Clear sound, you'll love these. They have all that and more.

They also have an app that you can use as an equalizer. You can use the 16 preset ones that are offered and they also post hundreds of other equalizer programs that you can try on your own. Of course you can also do your own custom equalizer . This is really cool for me since Apple Music does not offer an equalizer. Only the one on my IPhone 14+ and theirs is better.

They will also do wireless charging, which I'm not sure if I'm happy about that or not since I don't ever use it. I guess I should try it. Pretty much most better phones all come with wireless charging these days. It seems to be the wave of the future. so I’ll go out and get a wireless charger after searching online for hours lol.

The app that you have to download also has one button that you click to register for an 18-month warranty. Which is pretty cool since most sub $50 earbuds don't offer anything like this at all. From what I've read, their customer service is pretty decent, let's hope that's true.

The case is also a little bit smaller than most of the others that I have. Which I like since I can fit them into my pocket easily. They also have the battery charged status on the cover. All my others do not have this. I have to guess whether they're going to last or not when I take them out for the day. So this feature I really like. I’ve used them for four or five hours at a time and not had any issues with the charge status going below 20%. They also come with six sets of very comfortable earbuds caps. I'm not sure of the cool name, but you get the idea.

The earbuds connect effortlessly to my phone. I was happy with that since I have others that are real hassle to get them moving. A few of them, I have to open and close the case several times to get them to connect. Keep in mind this might be me because I’m kind of an idiot at times. But at least I’m honest lol

. I've also gone into several different rooms 30 to 40 ft away and I didn't lose any connections. I have a few sets of earbuds that are always fading in or out if I sneeze the wrong way.

A lot of these Amazon purchases that have glowing reviews are because the seller is somehow monetarily enticing people to leave a great review. I purchased these on my own at the full price and nobody is asking me to write anything lol. But since I was so impressed, I figured I would just fill you in on my thoughts.

As far as longevity though, I don't really know. But I'm guessing they'll hold up pretty well. But in my mind, I can just buy another set if they become broken or lost and keep doing that for about 5 years before I get to the price of one set Apple Airpod lol. I can promise you that you will love these. Good luck and thank you for reading."
"I picked these ear buds up based off of the raving reviews and I am not disappointed! These by far exceed my needs. I only use these to listen to music and for my workouts so I can't say how they are during phone calls. For music, they are great and sound a lot more expensive. They stay in my ears, and I have had no connection issues while I am active. I was surprised by how light they are so you don't really even notice them. One of my favorite features is the battery level displayed on the case when you open and close the lid. I can't tell you how many times I grab an older set I have, pop them in just to see the battery levels are low. I often don't even see the battery level until I run out the door and connect them to my phone. With these, I get a battery level reading at first glance. It even has wireless charging. The only downside with the wireless charging for me is I have a charging station that props your device up. and the case has the wireless charging connection on the bottom of the case. I have to set this case up facing on it's side which is not ideal. You can see in a picture I provided. This won't be an issue if you have a wireless charging pad. My other earbud case has wireless charging on the back side of the case so you can place it face up on a pad or facing out on the prop up charger. Either way it still works so I can't knock it too much. The noise cancelling is not active, so I feel these are not the best in that class. Overall, I highly recommend the Tozo T20 if you want earbuds that are affordable, sound amazing, have great battery, and are super comfortable!"
"I've been using these TOZO T20 for several weeks and I'm really enjoying them. Some of the reasons:
--They connected easily to my phone and computer, as well as the TOZO app.
--The charging case works great, and I love the LED power indicator. The case can be charged via USB or wirelessly. It’s also small and seems durable so far.
--Battery life has been excellent.
--They’re comfortable. And they stay securely in place, even during workouts.
--The sound is quite good. Very clear and rich.
--I’ve used them for both phone and video calls and have had no complaints– the dual mics with noise reduction perform admirably.
--The TOZO app allows you to adjust EQ settings for different genres and listening situations. Very cool.
--Lastly, you really can’t beat the price!
I’d highly recommend them."
"These T20 earbuds are the second Tozo earbuds I've purchased, and my fourth pair overall. As a value-conscious consumer, I've only purchased earbuds in the sub-$40 price range so far. Tozo T6s, Wyze Buds, Anker Soundcore P3i, and these Tozo T20s.

I've attached a few pictures of the outside of the box, the components when unboxing, and a picture of one of the pages of the user manual that comes with the earbuds describing the specs and the ""touch area"" for the controls (sorry about the crappy lighting).

The good:
*The price/value - This is very important to me.
*USB-C Charging - I really like my Tozo T6s, but the mini-USB on the bottom of the case was a pain. The T20s improve on that with a USB-C port on the back of the case.
*The battery / charge display on the case - Another point I really like is the display on the case. When flipping the lid up or down, the display on the case provides clear visual feedback on the state of battery for the case itself, as well as the each of the earbuds when they are charging the the case. The Tozo T6s have multiple LEDs on the case to indicate charge (good), but the Wyze and P3i's only have single LEDs to indicate if it's charging or not, but no clear way to know if it's 20%, 45%, 80%? I never knew how much I appreciated the T6 display until I tried the other earbuds and now the T20 display is EVEN BETTER.
*IPX6 rating - Granted, I haven't used these in the shower or underwater or out for my runs yet, but I do like that they're waterproof and sweatproof. I sweat a lot when I run so if, one: I can get these to stay in my ear, and two: they don't succumb to my sweat, I'll be happy.
*Mono listening - It's important to me that I can use the left, or right, or both earbuds. Often I only have one earbud in so I don't want earbuds that require you to keep both out of the case just to use them (Yes, some force you to do this. Why? I don't know)

The bad:
*Pause upon removal - All my other buds will autopause my media if I remove an earbud. These T20s don't. I hope that can be updated in the App or something, because I really like my podcasts to autopause when I have to pull my earbuds out because my wife or kids need my attention.
(Update 2023/09/24) - This seems to be intermittent. It didn't work on my computer, but it worked on my phone, which leads me to believe that the earbuds are designed for this, but the in/out-of-ear detection may just be a bit flawed.
*These earbuds are NOT for audiophiles. For my usage - YouTube, podcasts, some gaming, and music, these are fine. If you're capable of discerning that the 22Hz bass note is really supposed to be 24Hz in this song, then you probably need more fidelity than these sub $40 earbuds can provide.
*Form factor - I'm still partial to the Tozo T6s form. It's really just a personal preference. I've figured out that I prefer the earbuds without the kickstand that comes out of the ear.
*Touch area (see picture) - it's small, near the top of the buds, and doesn't really provide any tactile feedback that ""here's where to need to press"". Again, personal preference. I prefer the T6s or the P3i's (if you like the kickstand form factor) because the P3i's tactile area is basically anywhere on the whole kickstand part.

The OK / fine / ""this just 'is' "" features / operation:
*Bluetooth pairing & first use - I was able to pair these buds up to my computer without issue. Some of the other buds say ""Connecting"" or ""Pairing"" or make some unique startup sound upon first use or when they don't have a connection, but I didn't hear anything out of the T20s.
*Controls - I'm not sure if I can change the button presses in the Tozo App, some earbuds have that feature but I haven't downloaded the App yet. The volume, pause, and next/previous track controls do work as described in the included manual, though I noticed that on my computer that the Volume+ and Volume- were in increments of 5, i.e. once I paired them to my computer and set my volume to ""48"" in Windows, the Vol+ went to 53 then 58 then 63...same thing on the way back down. I did not have a chance to test the voice assistant or phone call controls yet.
*App - haven't tried it yet, but out of the box the earbuds work. Small tweaks / customizations I would make in the app would be changes to the actions for what button presses do, options to pause media when the earbuds are removed.
(Update 2023-09-24) - Not quite sure why the app is 80+MB, but it does have some sample music tracks, allows you to tweak the EQ on these T20s, and allows you to reconfigure the button presses. It prompts you to signup for a Tozo account, but it allows you to skip it as well. It is good that Tozo does NOT require an account to using the app, though it's clear from the UI design that a Tozo account is heavily encouraged.
*Dings - As I write this review, I have other media paused in the background. About every 10-15mins or so, the left earbuds is sending a chime. Yes, just the left one. I don't know if this is to indicate ""Hey, I'm still on, using battery, connected to your computer"" or a ""Disconnect/Reconnect"" event or what this chime means.

Things that I haven't really had a chance to test, but will report back if/when I do:
*Phone Audio Quality - I have a loud coworker that I take conference calls next to. When using the T6s, I get complaints from colleagues that they can hear him. I'm going to try these T20s to see if the microphone is better in background noise reduction.
*Noise cancelling - I wouldn't hang my hat on this feature. I'm sure it's there, but if you've ever had a chance to use legitimate noise cancelling headphones, these won't hold a candle to those. Generally though, if you size your ear tips correctly (Tozo provides a few different sizes with the buds), then they do a good job isolating noise.
*Battery Life - Not sure how long these will last, but if they're anything like the T6s, I'm pretty happy with how long the battery goes, and how quick it charges.

Would I recommend?
Yes! If you're looking for some functional earbuds that won't break the bank, I'd give these Tozo buds a chance to see if they're a fit for you."
"I already owned the Tozo T9 & the Tozo T6 when I ordered the Tozo T20. In my experience with Tozo, they're always worth the money, and then some. Why did I buy these? I do most of my music listening while lying on my side in bed. The T6 protrude way too far from the ear canal to ever be comfortable at all while doing this. The T9 protrude much less, but are still bulky enough to be quite uncomfortable lying on my side. The T20 are much smaller. They are the most comfortable pair of earbuds for side-lying that I've found. I wouldn't say they're exactly comfortable, but they're the best so far. I was also hoping that these would have more bass than the T9. They don't. I'd say they sound exactly like the T9, which isn't a bad thing. I've heard from Tozo customer support that their NC2 have better bass. They are about the same size as the T9, so I know they won't be as comfortable as the T20 for my needs, but I'm satisfied enough with Tozo & curious enough about the bass to give them a try. Every pair of buds I've tried that has excellent bass has been too uncomfortable for me to lie on my side with them in. If Tozo ever releases a pair with sufficient bass for my standards that fit like the T20, i'll buy them in bulk. I can't understand why people pay hundreds of dollars for earbuds that aren't as good as what Tozo gives you for a fraction of the price. Tozo is a brand that is inexpensive, sounds great, is well made, has an app with lots of options & has top-notch customer service. The T20 are comfortable for normal use & comfortable enough for lying on your side with them in your ears. They sound great, look great & cost far less than any brand out there that are worth buying. Btw, I owned a pair of Airpods Pro for a year while I briefly owned an iPhone. Tozo earbuds look better, sound better & cost around 10 times less. For Android at least, these are a much better option. If my phone's Bluetooth is turned on, all I do is open the Tozo case & the buds instantly pair. I recommend these to anyone, except maybe iPhone users who want options only Apple products can give you, and audiophiles, who will swear more expensive earbuds mean better earbuds.
Edit: I will say I can't necessarily recommend these for phone calls. When myy sister calls me, she says she can never hear me when I have these in. (Although I've used them for video calls without a hitch.)"
"5 stars due value, quality and utility. There are better earbuds out there, but for a whole lot more $$. These are my 3rd pair of Tozo earbuds (also T-1 and T-12 Pro) so that should say a lot.

It all started when I was looking to replace a broken pair of (big name) earbuds that I keep in my gym bag. I did a lot of research before buying my first pair of Tozo's, the T-12 Pro. Since then, I ordered the T-1 for my wife and the T-12 Pro's as my ""gym-workout"" pair. You really cannot go wrong if you're looking for an affordable pair of earbuds that will exceed your expectations for the money.

I picked the T-20's due to the number of good reviews & the price (on sale). I wanted a pair of earbuds to keep for when I am working out or cycling. For their intended purpose (to listen to music or video while exercising) they are great.

Sound: The T-20's exceed my needs and expectations. I can listen to music or watch a video while exercising. Sound reproduction is very good with noticeable highs and lows. The Tozo (mixer) App however appears to have -0- effect on mixing bass and treble (see update below, I got it to work). I find that I am better off using the Apple sound mixer on my IPhone. Overall, the sound is as good or better than the old earbuds that they replaced that were 5X more expensive.

Fit: No issues. Tozo also includes earbud pads in different sizes to fit your ears.

Features: Raise and lower volume, advance, stop or start music just by tapping R or L Bud.

Case: Love the digital battery level display on the carry case vs. my Apple earbuds where the battery charge % only appears on my I-Phone. This is a great feature that everyone should copy.

Taking calls: I d/n/k because I have yet to take a call while using the T-20's. I D/N/K if the Tozo will announce calls like my Apple Pro's.

Fit: They stay in my ears. Never once have the T-20s fell out (the Apple earbuds have on several occasions). I have had no connection issues, not noticed the weight of the buds. I would say that they are just fine.

Charging: I use cables so it's a non-issue for me. I do not use wireless or a charging stand. Recharging is fast.

Noise Canceling: Have yet to figure out how to activate. For now, the Apple NC on my Apple Pro's is the gold standard, even better than the Bose NC.

Overall: For the price ($30 +/- now on Amazon) how can you go wrong? You get a first-class pair of earbuds at a fraction of the cost of a ""big name"" manufacturer's buds. I recommend the Tozo T20's for anyone who wants a pair of earbuds that are affordable, comfortable, have a very good sound projection and a long battery life.

UPDATE:
Sound Mixer: I was finally able to figure out how to use the ""equalizer"" function in the app. The app works and works well.

Taking calls: I received a TC a few days ago. No, the Tozo's did not announce calls like the Apple Pro's, but I was able to determine that I had a call coming in. The call was clear and I experienced no issues."
"I've been using the Tozo T20 True Wireless Stereo Earbuds for a week now, and I'm thoroughly impressed. The sound quality is simply fantastic, with deep bass and crystal-clear highs that are a delight. .

One of the standout features for me is the comfortable fit. These lightweight earbuds come with multiple ear tip sizes, so it was easy to find the perfect fit for my ears. They stay securely in place and I barely notice them.

The battery life is excellent as well. I can easily get through a full day of use without needing to recharge, and the charging case is compact and convenient to carry around. The touch controls are intuitive and responsive.

Overall, the Tozo T20 Earbuds offer outstanding value for the price. They deliver premium sound quality, a comfortable fit, and reliable performance. Highly recommended."
":: Battery ::
Impressive! I've been using these ~2 hours per day for a week and the case is still showing 70% battery remaining, and that's from the initial change from opening the box. I have yet to plug these in.

:: Case ::
Really (aesthetically) slick and beautiful. The lid snaps shut with a pleasant *click* and the magnets ensure it doesn't open by accident. The battery life readout is pleasantly muted, but clear - not too bright while being easily readable. The case is also much more compact than other earbuds I've used, so they fit easily in my pocket.

:: Fit ::
Maybe I happen to have ears that perfectly accommodate the shape of these buds, but they're super comfortable. I use them primarily while running, which means I mostly have them in for 45-60 minutes at a time. They stay put very nicely, no need to occasionally push them in or adjust them. And no discomfort after wearing them for a long time. With other products, I'll get a dull ache after a while, which only gets worse with time - doesn't happen with these.

:: Sound ::
Admittedly, I'm not an audiophile, but I've got no qualms with the sound. The sound is at least as good as every other pair of earbuds I've used. The EQ provided with the Android app is fully customizable, which is nice. It also brings me to my sole complaint...

:: App ::
Why am I *required* to enable location settings... simply to adjust the EQ settings? This feels really invasive and unnecessary. Also, the app needs literally one single function - to adjust the sound. There's a Product tab, which shows more Tozo products. A Community tab? These are earbuds, it's not my whole life. I mean, there's no real downside to those extras, it just seems excessive. And yes, the location thing rubs me the wrong way.

:: TL;DR ::
Quality sound, amazing fit and battery life, adore the case, and would buy these again and again. The app is annoying, but not enough of a problem to ding a star."
"Ever since my first pair of t-10s(which still work flawlessly), I have only purchased tozos and recommended tozos to friends as they consistently beat every other headphone company for value, build quality, and customer support. These headphones are no exception to their consistency.

The T20 are very standard earbuds, with good sound quality, nice quality build and no extra bells and whistles. One thing i noticed, is this case has a display which shows earbuds charge % which is an awesome improvement I hope tozo keeps on all new products.

The sound quality is understandably less impressive than their ANC/higher priced lines but this is also a much more affordable product, so this is more for those looking for budget option, as tozo has many options in the higher price tiers.

As usual tozo includes different size ear tips for all ears and a USB c cable of good quality.

Highly recommend these earbuds if you're looking for very solid build quality, size, decent sound quality all for a great price. I expect these to last for a long time, as I have owned several pairs of tozos for years and only had them break when I ran them through the washer and dryer on accident."
"Review of Tozo T20 Earbuds: A Detailed Comparison with Tozo T12

I have had a pair of the T12 earbuds for nearly a year and love them, but I travel on long-haul flights often and wanted a better fit and longer battery life, so I am trying out the T20s. For those who don't want to read a long review, bottom line for me is that I prefer the sound of the T12s, but the fit of the T20s, so use the T20s for when I will be wearing them for several hours (like binge-watching movies on 15 hr flights) and when exercising (they stay in better), and will use the T12s when I want better sound for shorter periods.

The Tozo T20 earbuds and Tozo T12 earbuds represent two different generations in Tozo's line-up of affordable true wireless earbuds, offering a blend of features aimed at different user needs. Let’s dive into a comparison to help you understand how these two models stack up against each other.

Tozo T20 Earbuds:

The Tozo T20 earbuds are designed to offer a balanced mix of performance and comfort at a reasonable price. Here’s a breakdown of their features:

Design & Comfort: The T20s have a compact and ergonomic design, ensuring a snug fit for most ear shapes. They come with multiple sizes of ear tips to enhance comfort and achieve a good seal, which is crucial for passive noise isolation. For long flights (12+ hours), I found them more comfortable than the T12s and they stay in my ears better, so less time crawling around on the floor of the plane looking for dropped aer buds.

Sound Quality: These earbuds deliver a solid audio experience with balanced sound. They have a slightly enhanced bass which should please those who enjoy a bit of punch in their music, though they might not satisfy audiophiles looking for a more neutral sound profile.

Battery Life: The T20s provide about 8 hours of playback on a single charge - about 30% more than the T20s, with the case offering an additional 24 hours. This is quite competitive in the budget category and ensures you can get through a full day of use without worrying about running out of power.

Features: They support touch controls for playback, volume, and calls, which is a nice feature for convenience. They are also IPX8 rated for water resistance, making them suitable for workouts and light rain.

Connectivity: The T20s use Bluetooth 5.0, which provides a stable connection and better range compared to older Bluetooth versions. The pairing process is straightforward and reliable.

Tozo T12 Earbuds:

The Tozo T12 earbuds are a step up in terms of design and technology compared to the T20s. Here’s how they compare:

Design & Comfort: The T12s have a slightly bulkier design and while the fit is great, they are heavier, so are not as comfortable as the T20s after several hours and fall out of my ears more easily. They also come with various ear tip sizes, but the fit may not be as universally comfortable as the T20s for everyone.

Sound Quality: The T12s offer a more refined audio experience with a clearer sound and better separation between frequencies. They tend to provide a more detailed soundstage, which is a notable improvement over the T20s. The bass is still present but less overpowering, making them suitable for a wider range of music genres.

Battery Life: Battery life is comparable to the T20s, with around 6 hours per charge and an additional 24 hours from the case. While this is decent, it’s slightly less than the T20s, which may be a consideration for heavy users.

Features: The T12s also support touch controls and come with an IPX8 rating for water resistance. Additionally, they offer wireless charging capability for the case, which adds a level of convenience for tech enthusiasts.

Connectivity: Like the T20s, the T12s feature Bluetooth 5.0, ensuring good connectivity and range.

Comparison Summary:

Sound Quality: The T12s have a more detailed and refined sound compared to the T20s, making them better for those who prioritize audio quality.

Battery Life: The T20s edge out the T12s slightly in terms of battery longevity per charge, though both provide a similar total battery life when including the case.

Design & Comfort: Both models are comfortable, but the T20s may offer a more universally comfortable fit due to their slightly smaller size.

Features: The T12s offer the added convenience of wireless charging for the case, which the T20s lack.

In conclusion, if audio quality and wireless charging are your top priorities, the Tozo T12 earbuds would be the better choice. However, if you value a longer battery life and a snug fit, the Tozo T20 earbuds might be more suitable. Both models provide excellent value for their price, making them strong contenders in the budget true wireless earbud market."
"I’m going to preface this review by saying that this is the first Tozo review I’ve written, primarily because I couldn’t find a helpful review, video, or blog post about the T20s anywhere when I was researching before I purchased. Full disclaimer, Tozo is my favorite “budget” earbud brand. And no, I was not paid to post this review and or given anything for free in exchange for my review (if my rating didn’t give that away).

This is going to be a very long review, so tldr; the fit is good, the sound is phenomenal, but making phone calls was unsuccessful outside of a completely silent environment. If you don’t want ANC and don’t need to make phone calls, the T20s pack some truly “best in class” features.

To start, I wasn’t kidding when I said Tozo is my favorite “budget” brand of earbuds. I own T9s (my “daily” drivers), T10s (my go-to gym buds), T12s (primarily for travel - they are SUPER comfortable), and a pair of NC2’s. I was gifted the NC2’s by a family member after they heard me rave about the brand so often, but all other pairs I purchased for under $50 each, and probably closer to between $30-40/pair, hence the “budget” reference. The T20s are the first pair of Tozo buds I’ve spent more than $50 on, and the most I’ve spent on a Tozo product to date. At this price point, I feel like being critical is justified.

Let’s start with the pros:

- Sound. One word: outstanding. I seriously can’t believe how good these sound for under $100. I would put them up against my wife’s Beats Studio Buds or my old pair of AirPod Pros (1st Gen) any day. If I had to find something to be critical about here, I’d say the bass could be a bit deeper (the T10s have awesome bass, by comparison, and Beats are obviously best-in-class in this area), but honestly, they still win out over those 1st gen AirPod Pros.

- Comfort. I’m going to put this in the Pros, but overall I’d say they’re only slightly above average here. They feel good enough to be a daily driver, but I’d say they’re still pretty comparable to the fit of the much cheaper T9s. By comparison, the T12s are the most comfortable buds I’ve ever owned. These T20s are obviously a different style than the T12s, so I’d expect them to fit differently, but they aren’t constantly falling out of my ears like similarly designed buds from other brands, so that’s a win.

- The case. I could write an entire chapter about how much I love this case. The size is convenient, the weight and finish have a premium feel, the display is clear (and from what I can tell, accurate), the lid closes securely and isn’t even the slightest bit flimsy, wireless charging works flawlessly, the design choice to put the usb-c port on the back of the case instead of the bottom like so many others is a stroke of genius, the buds are very easy to remove and replace, and the ability for the case to stand upright on its own is the bow on top. I will note that somehow my case came with some kind of dent or scratch on it, but since I can’t say for sure that it left the factory like that and I love everything else functionally and aesthetically so much, I can’t ding these earbuds for that.

- Battery Life. Again, I’ll put this in the Pros, but I’d still say it’s probably about average overall. The battery life is rated to be about the same as the NC2s, but I honestly rarely use those as I find that I probably get closer to 6hrs per charge instead of the 10hrs advertised. I haven’t let the T20s completely run out of battery, but I’ve run them multiple times for at least 8 hours out of the case listening to music, podcasts, and watching videos (I’ll be discussing calls in the next section), so I’m confident saying that the battery life advertised is accurate.

- Gestures. Gestures work flawlessly; they are even borderline too sensitive. I much prefer the increased sensitivity to a lack of it, and definitely prefer the sensor over the physical buttons on the T10s. I often find myself accidentally pausing music when adjusting the earbuds, even when I’m very careful about where I touch, so some people might see this as more of a con.

Moving on to the Cons:

- Connectivity. This seems primarily dependent on what I’m connected to. When I connect to my MacBook, I never have issues with connectivity. When I’m connected to my iPhone 14 Pro, I run into *fairly* frequent issues where I get either feedback of some sort (usually brief static) or one or both earbuds will quickly skip in and out. This seems to happen whether my phone is in my hand or sitting 2 feet away on my desk. At first I wanted to blame my phone, especially since this doesn’t seem to happen with my MacBook, but this doesn’t happen with any other buds I own, Tozo or otherwise. It’s probably something minor that a future firmware update will fix.

- Range. I can’t say that the range of these earbuds is any worse than the other Tozos I own (I can maybe get about 10ft from my phone before I start to lose connection), but at nearly double the price point of the other buds, I’d have to say this is a negative. $50+ earbuds should just have bette range, IMO. This is one area where even my old 1st Gen AirPod Pros excelled. With those AirPods, I remember once driving away from my house and I probably got at least 20 yards (maybe more) from my house before I lost connection and realized I had left my phone at home.

- Phone Calls. Phone calls are the MAIN reason for my overall 2* rating. If these buds had better phone calls, these would be at least 4* buds, and possibly even 5* with a future firmware update fixing the connection stability. Phone calls are an absolute necessity for me, and the experience making calls with the T20s has been so poor that I consider them almost unusable. The voice on the other end comes through crystal clear, but apparently I am so hard to hear in an environment that’s not “library silent” that I literally can’t take phone calls anywhere outside of my home office. Whether I’m in the car or somewhere with even more background noise like a grocery store, or even worse, the gym, I’m constantly being asked to repeat myself or told to “just call back later when I’m not busy.” It’s become such an inconvenience that I’ve had to stop using the T20s altogether despite all of their otherwise great qualities. To make matters worse, even Siri and Alexa are constantly asking me to repeat myself, or making some completely unrelated action or comment, when I activate the voice control function. Maybe this can be fixed with a firmware update as well, but there’s clearly something wrong with the microphone out of the box.

Honorable mentions:

- The Tozo App. I’m sure the app is great, but the sound is so good out of the box, I really don’t think it’s needed. If you’re more of an audiophile than I am, or prefer different genres of music (I’m a self-proclaimed metal head), you might get more use out of it than I did. It offers a wide array of default sound profiles, as well as the ability to customize your own. I also like that it shows the current battery life and you can use it to easily update the firmware when needed. It’s also completely free.

- IPX8. I didn’t test this, but IPX8 (true waterproof) with this style bud is pretty awesome.

- Active Noise Cancelling (ANC). No, these are not noise canceling earbuds. In my experience, noise cancelling is great when it works, but just nukes the battery. These buds fit snugly and securely enough in my ears that I really don’t miss the ANC. This is personal preference, of course, so your mileage may vary.

To summarize: the problems with phone calls were a deal breaker for me, but if you’re not going to use the T20s for calls and have a budget between $50-100, these are, hands-down, the best earbuds I’ve tried in this price range with a few small caveats mentioned above. Sound quality, physical build quality, and comfort are stand out features.

If you’re like me, you’ve researched and compared every earbud in this price range you can find. Also, if you’re like me, you were frustrated when you couldn’t find a single review, YouTube video, or Reddit post that even mentions the T20s let alone actually reviews them (at least at the time of writing). If you’ve made it this far, hopefully you got something useful out of this review. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk."
"Tozo T20 Earbuds Review

The Tozo T20 wireless earbuds offer a solid balance of sound quality, comfort, and affordability. Right out of the box, they have a sleek and compact design, and the charging case is small enough to fit in a pocket, making it super portable.

Sound Quality:

The sound profile is well-rounded with a strong emphasis on bass, which is great for those who enjoy a bass-heavy listening experience. The mids and highs are clear, though they don’t shine as much as the bass. For casual listeners, the sound is satisfying, but audiophiles might notice a slight lack of depth in the upper range.

Comfort & Fit:

The earbuds come with multiple ear tips, allowing you to find a comfortable fit. They stay snug even during workouts, which is a major plus. However, the fit might feel a bit tight during extended use for some people.

Battery Life:

The battery life is impressive, lasting up to 6 hours on a single charge, with the case providing an additional 24 hours of charge. It’s enough to get through a full day without worrying about constantly charging them.

Connectivity:

Pairing is seamless and quick with Bluetooth 5.0. They maintain a stable connection even at a reasonable distance from the source device. The touch controls are responsive, though they might take some getting used to.

Water Resistance:

With an IPX8 rating, the T20s are great for workouts or even light rain, providing peace of mind for those who lead active lifestyles.

Overall:

For the price point, the Tozo T20 offers a great listening experience with decent sound quality, reliable battery life, and excellent portability. They’re ideal for anyone looking for budget-friendly wireless earbuds without sacrificing too much in terms of performance."
"I've had Tozo's T8s, T12s, and Crystal buds. All have been pretty good. I picked these up when my Crystals got lost in a move.

Pros:
- Price -- on sale these are a steal

- Connect easily, rarely lose connection even if I leave my phone in one place and wander the apartment with them in

- Solid sound, comparable to the Crystals and very customizable through the app. Slightly larger drivers than the Crystals, and I feel this reflects in their ability to deliver bass. The default tuning is a little heavy on the treble for my taste, but it's a nice change of pace from other cheap earbuds that overtune the bass into muddiness.

- Good fit achievable with the wide range of included eartip sizes (they even color matched them -- the red buds get pinkish tips, etc)

- Availability of bright colors makes it easier to find the earbuds in my house of all black items

- Wireless charging works perfectly, though only with phone wireless chargers (won't work on the earbuds/watch half of a double Samsung wireless charger for example, but works on the phone side)

-Solid battery life (6-8 hours before needing to recharge the buds in the case)

- LED display is great as always

Cons:
- The overall look is cheesier and cheaper than the Crystal buds with their slick clear/black case -- the case is giving McDonalds Toy plastic a bit with its light, thin, matte plastic

- Sensitive touch controls that are easy to trigger when adjusting, though I get around this by handling them primarily by the stems

- Not as slick a form factor as the Crystals -- less comfortable for wearing to sleep as they stick out a bit more, but some people will prefer the Airpods-esque stem design

Overall, Tozo continues to make the best budget wireless earbuds."
"I was on the hunt for a pair of waterproof earbuds, specifically with an IPX8 rating, since my Apple AirPods aren’t waterproof. The TOZO T20 caught my attention, and I couldn’t be happier with my decision. For just $20 after the $10 coupon, these are by far the best value earbuds I’ve come across.

The sound quality blew me away—surprisingly, they sound even better than my AirPods Pro 2nd gen! I didn’t expect that at all, but the 10mm drivers deliver deep, rich sound that’s hard to believe at this price point. Bass is punchy, and the clarity across all frequencies is excellent.

Another bonus is the TOZO app. It’s a great feature that most other budget brands don’t even offer. The app allows you to customize sound settings and more, which is such a nice touch at this price level.

I noticed some reviews mentioning an issue with water activating the touch controls, but there’s a simple fix for that: just download the TOZO app and turn off the touch controls. Problem solved!

If you’re looking for affordable, waterproof earbuds with amazing sound and features, these are it. Highly recommend!"
"Grape tomato and goldfish snack for size comparison. :)

We have a lot of Tozo products for all my devices. We currently have 2 of their chargers, 1 around the head headphones, and 6 ear buds. I like them all for different reasons. Here's my pro/con list for these.

Pros:

⭐️ Comfortable and surprisingly interchangeable. Seems like they shouldn’t be, but technically I can put the right ear in my left ear and barely feel a difference. This is a huge plus for me!
⭐️ I LOVE that I can see the charge level on the outside for both the case and the headphones. This is an amazing upgrade!
⭐️ The color is wonderful. I went with the darker blue.
⭐️ The case stands upright. Seems silly, but the one I have that doesn’t bothers me.
⭐️ Of course the sound quality is top notch, loud, and I can barely hear a thing if I have two in at normal volume. They’re definitely noise canceling.

Cons:

⭐️ I have to put the right side in the right side to charge. If I have both out, it takes me a second to figure out which one goes where when my brain is tired.

That’s it! Shortest cons list I’ve ever made for a review."
"I previously had the TOZO T9 earbuds and liked them quite a bit. I had one earbud go bad on me so I bought the newer T20. While these are good earbuds, I have an ongoing issue with the Bluetooth connection with these and my Pixel 8 Pro (same issue with the Galaxy S21 Ultra). The issue I have is that the audio will randomly become unintelligible. If I handle the phone the issue will clear up. So there is some sort of reception issue. I did not have this issue with the T9 on the same phones. Likewise, no issue with my Bose QC headphones. Maybe I just got a bad one. I still use these every day. I just know that if the audio goes wonky I need to take my phone out of my pocket.

I really like the charge % being visible on the case. That is a nice touch. The case uses USB-C to charge and it charges quickly. The package includes several size cushions for the earbuds so you can get the right fit.

So I am disappointed with the Bluetooth issue, but it is not a deal breaker and next time I need earbuds I will again consider TOZO devices."
"I was shopping around for new earbuds and looked at several brands. Including the big brand names. After reading the positive reviews and seeing that there was a promotion going on, I decided to try these out. I was already familiar with the brand because I had bought some wireless headphones before and was satisfied with those, so I was hopeful.

At first, I had an issue with the right one turning on and syncing but it could have been user mistake. After a few tries I got it work and got it synced to my phone. Sound quality is pretty good and noise cancellation is pretty good as well. The BIGGEST issue is the battery life. (Considering they promote long battery life on these) My picture shows the case charged at 95%, three minutes before it was at 100%. To me that seems like a big jump is just a few minutes. Also, the earbuds went from 100% to 67% in about 30mins of use. I’ll continue to give these a try for a few more days before deciding if I need to return them.

I really want to like these. Will update at a later time."
"After researching multiple earbuds from cheap to expensive I settled on the Tozo T20 in blue. I just received them and have only been listening for a few minutes, but so far they have been excellent. Sound quality is fantastic. I love the wireless charging and ease of checking the charge status. While not active noise cancelling, they do suppress a lot of noise with the ear bud design and silicone tips.

I have some expensive Sony wireless over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones and multiple types of apple wired headphones, but I was looking for a wireless, affordable option for when wires get in the way and you need in the ear (like when working out/running).

Many family members recommended Tozo to me and I see why. My wife has the A1, my brother has the T20, and my sister in law has another model (not sure which one) that she has had for multiple years with no issue. I tried my wife’s A1 ear buds and they impressed me, but I wanted stems and the added features of the T20.

Fit is good and these seem like they will be great for use while working out or performing other activities. So far this appears to be a great product and I have no complaints, especially for the price point. I am looking forward to trying the app for EQ settings, but have not tried it yet."
"The Tozo T20 Airbuds offer a commendable balance of performance and affordability. Featuring a sleek design, these earbuds are comfortable and fit securely, making them suitable for extended use. They provide good sound quality with a clear, balanced audio profile and decent bass, though they may lack the depth found in higher-end models.

One of their standout features is the IPX8 waterproof rating, which ensures they can withstand sweat and rain, making them ideal for workouts and outdoor activities. The battery life is impressive, offering up to 6 hours of playtime on a single charge, with the charging case extending this to around 24 hours.

Connectivity is solid, with Bluetooth 5.0 ensuring a stable connection and quick pairing with devices. However, some users may find the touch controls a bit finicky, and the lack of noise-cancellation can be a downside in noisy environments.

Overall, the Tozo T20 Airbuds provide excellent value for money, especially for those looking for reliable, budget-friendly earbuds with good sound quality and durability."
"At first, I thought these were a lot like the @pple pods, but I was really impressed by the performance.
I was able to listen on either phone without worry, I used these for numerous activities around the house, and with decent distance from the phone with no problem.
I picked them up with the TOZO wireless charging pad, and they charge wirelessly too. that surprised me, but maybe I missed it in the description.
The sound is pretty good, and unlike older Tozo buds I've tried, the buds don't continuously discharge on me. Because of this, I kept them in pocket for a week without use (intentional) and still had 90+ percent charge on buds and case when checked.
Thought I'd give these to the kid, but I'm second guessing myself."
"One thing that has solidified my love of TOZO brand earphones is the fact their app has equalizer features, customization of the touch controls and it is all in a compact and comfortable package. Set up and connecting is easy. The software is upgradable. These rival big name brands that I’ve bought and I may honestly like them more than my AirPods Pro or Skullcandy Sesh ANC. The battery life blows other manufacturers earbuds away. The color I got just makes me happy. The only thing that would make these better is if like the TOZO T10 they had a built in lanyard hole and lanyard. I started with the T10 and then I found TOZO HT2 and had to have those because I don’t always want in ear headphones. My point is, I have became a huge fan and fast. These T20 will be my work and daily carry pair. The calls using them, the person on the other end told me sounded great and clear. Tiny thing to mention that made me happy, the silicone earbud replacement tips are marked/embossed with the size on each silicone tip.(not sure if you’ll be able to see but I did add a photo to demonstrate the size range and their markings) There’s not guessing that you’ve made a proper set. They come default with the Medium tips on. The tips are XXL-XS that’s a fantastic range and ensures that you will find your perfect fit. Thank you TOZO for making affordable headphones with premium features!"
"I used to have the TOZOs T21 and T6, and I can say without a doubt that the T20s are my favorite! The design is sleek and color-customizable, which I extremely like. The main difference between the T20 and T21 is the use of rubber tips — which the T20 has. Since the packaging comes with multiple rubber tip sizes, I was able to adjust the T20s to my preference, which the T21s don't offer.

The battery life and sound quality are excellent with all TOZO products that I have purchased, and the T20s are no exception. I was able to use the earbuds for at least 6 hours until they needed to recharge in their case, and the case lasted for about 4-5 full charges. The functionality of the T20s are roughly the same as their other earbuds - you can tap to pause, increase and decrease volume, or switch between songs, podcasts, and Tiktok videos (if you adjust your Settings). There is also a separate TOZO app that allows me to easily make adjustments to the functionality of the T20s (ie: if I want to change double taps from skipping a song to some other feature).

I highly also recommend purchasing the separate W2 chargers from TOZO — I got them in a bundle and absolutely love being able to wirelessly recharge the T20 case and my phone. There is also a current 50% off sale, alongside a 20% off coupon, which definitely makes the T20s a great bang for your buck :)"
"I wasn't convinced that I would enjoy and appreciate as much as I do, these T-20 earbuds. The price told me they couldn't be as good as more expensive options. But, because of the price, I couldn't resist.

I received the earbuds in good order, the packaging was effective and easy enough to get into. Pairing and connecting have been a breeze. The fact that I can charge the storage case and keep the earbuds fully charged while away from AC power is great feature.

Like all touch sensitive earbuds, I had to get comfortable with inserting and rearranging the buds, but I expected that.

Overall, this purchase was definitely 5 stars. I recommend these earbuds to anyone that is looking for a quality, easy-to-use piece of gear that delivers very good sound."
"I’m coming from Apple AirPods Pro. The left earbud is making a screeching noise every time I put it on. Needless to say, after spending 200$ on pair of earphones, I’m not spending the same. The AirPods did last close to 4 and half year. I decided to try the Tozo T20 earbuds.
It’s been a month I’ve been using this pair. Here is a short review -

Pros
1. Price - I got these for 30$
2. Connectivity - quickly connects to my iPhone
3. Easy charging

Cons
Sound quality is average. I mean you can’t get it any better for 30$ I guess.

If this one lasts for even half the life of my AirPods, I’m more than happy. I’ll update this post if something goes wrong with this one."
"I ordered the T20's for my wife last month to replace a different set that went through the wash a few times. These are supposed to be more water resistant, and are a good bit better quality than the ones she had, clear audio and the microphones have passable noice detection. She just pointed out to me that despite using both earbuds together for hours at a time, she's only had to charge the case for the first time this past Monday amd its still at 85% nearly a week later!
If you need a decent set of earbuds, that'll keep going for weeks at a time, seems you can't go wrong with the T20's."
"Ok let's start with it's tozo so they have a wide range of products , if you wa t premium go for the golden x1 fron tozo

If you are on a budget then these are probably there best budget friendly in the line up and I would personally say the most comfortable for the price too

Comes with a charging case with indicator in numbers which is extremely helpful

The sound is mid range

Not super heavy base but it's there enough to not miss it .
Highs are lacking which is expected at this price range

But for cheap do what you need and better then other competitors at the price then I would say give these a go"
"I use these earbuds every day, and the sound quality is excellent. However, due to the structure of my ear canals, I can't wear them for long periods—more than an hour and I start to feel uncomfortable. After switching to the smaller ear tips they provided, the discomfort improved by about 30% to 50%, and they don't fall out easily. Although the actual battery life isn't as long as advertised, unless you use them at a lower volume (around 25%), they still last quite a while, so I charge them about once or twice a week. I recommend them for anyone looking for budget-friendly earbuds that offer great value and quality."
"I recently picked up the TOZO T20 earbuds and am genuinely impressed. For their price point, these earbuds offer exceptional value and performance that rivals more expensive options. Some of the key features I noticed were better than some earbuds I had previously used.

Comfort and Fit: The TOZO T20 earbuds come in multiple sizes and have ear tips that ensure a comfortable and secure fit. They're lightweight and ergonomic, making them perfect for extended listening sessions. Whether I'm working out or just lounging at home, they stay in place and never cause discomfort.
Sound Quality: The sound quality is remarkable, with rich bass, crisp highs, and a balanced midrange that brings your music to life. Whether listening to my favorite playlists or catching up on podcasts, the TOZO T20 delivers clear, immersive audio. The soundstage feels broad and dynamic, making for an engaging listening experience.
Ease of Use: Pairing them with my devices was seamless, and the controls were intuitive. The touch-sensitive controls are responsive and allow me to easily manage my music and calls without fumbling with my phone.
Additional Features: The TOZO T20 also offers good passive noise isolation, which is great for focusing in noisy environments. While it doesn't have active noise cancellation, it does a commendable job of minimizing external distractions.
Overall, if you're looking for high-quality earbuds without breaking the bank, these are worth considering. I highly recommend them!"
"I really like these earbuds is the sound quality. I listen to a wide variety of music and enjoy listening with the TOZO T20 earbuds. The batters life is as advertised, outstanding.

The problem I had is getting the black earbuds to pair with my
Apple iPad. While they paired right up with my iPhone. It wasn’t until I looked at the comparison chart of all the different colors of the T20 I noticed that the black does not have bluetooth, while the other colors do have Bluetooth.

This was not discovered until it was too late to return them. So if you want the TOZO T20 to work across multiple devices; such as in my case an iPhone and iPad purchase one of the other colors.

For the price you will not be disappointed with the T20 sound quality and the battery life."
"I've been using the TOZO T20 Wireless Earbuds and I'm thoroughly impressed with their performance and features. The 10mm speakers with large dynamic drivers deliver impressive stereo sound. The bass is particularly good, and the overall sound is full and vivid.

With a full 13 hours of playtime on a single charge and 48.5 hours total with the case, these earbuds provide excellent play time.

Waterproof rating of IPX8 rating means I can use them during workouts or in a light rain.

The ergonomic design and 6 different ear tip sizes ensure a comfortable and a secure fit.

The TOZO App provides the ability to customize EQ settings and is a great feature for personalizing the sound.

Dual Mic ENC ensures call quality is clear, with effective noise reduction during conversations.

Charging Options include both wireless and USB-C charging.

An LED display on the case is a handy feature."
"I’ve been using these almost daily for the past 8 months and have nothing but good things to say about them. The sound quality, battery life, charging speed and fit all were well above my expectations.

No trouble keeping them in my ears with a comfortable fit. I wear them 5-6 hours a day comfortably. Easy to use controls that I can even use my forearm when unable to use my hands.

They have a great sound and if you put the Tozo app on your phone, you can adjust the range of sound to your preference. It works wonderfully in loud areas. I operate loud machines working under locomotives and have the volume set at the highest recommended. Still has more volume available to raise it and I can hear clearly.

They charge up quickly when placed in the charger. The case shows you how much charge it has and has charging indicators for the earbuds that also show their battery level. The Tozo app gives you an exact battery percentage. The case charges fairly quickly as well.

I wouldn’t hesitate to buy these again. For the price, you’ll be extremely happy with them."
"This is my first pair of nonconnected wireless earbuds. I considered various Apple air pods in the past but avoided them because of the poor fit of standard Apple earbuds, and the probability of clumsily losing one of them the first week of ownership.

The TOZO T20 has been a very pleasant surprise. The earbuds are fairly low profile, comfortable, and stay in my ears. I use them mostly at night in bed but would feel comfortable working out with these in my ears. I mostly listen to podcasts and audiobooks, am not an audiophile, but suspect that most users would find these reasonable for music. I haven't used them for phone calls and therefore can't comment on the mike. After only a month of ownership I can't comment on durability, thus only a four-star rating. They hold a charge as advertised and can be recharged several times by the case. So far, I'm delighted with these. They are a bargain in $25 to $30 price range."
"I recently purchased this product, and I am thoroughly impressed! The product exceeded my expectations in every way. The quality is outstanding, and it works exactly as described.

One of the best features is [specific feature], which has made a significant difference in [how it improved your experience]. It’s clear that a lot of thought went into the design and functionality of this product.

This product is also very user-friendly and easy to set up, even for someone who isn’t very tech-savvy. The instructions were clear, and everything worked seamlessly from the start.

In terms of value for money, this product is definitely worth every penny. It’s durable, well-made, and performs better than similar products I’ve tried in the past.

I would highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for [type of product]. It’s a top-notch product that delivers on its promises."
"I've tried several products from the Tozo brand, and among them, these headphones truly stand out for the following reasons:

Impressive battery life: The battery lasts incredibly long; I've had to charge them very few times, and I'm genuinely impressed by their battery life, with over 25 hours of continuous use. Additionally, the case displays the remaining battery percentages, which, although a small detail, significantly enhances the user experience.

Effective noise cancellation: The noise cancellation really works, even in noisy environments. This is especially noticeable in gyms, where loud music and conversations can be distracting. With the noise cancellation, I can focus on the music I want to hear and concentrate better on my workout.

Water-resistant: With an IPX8 rating, these headphones are perfect for people who sweat a lot. Sometimes, headphones slip or fall due to sweat, but this model doesn't have that issue, as the aerodynamic design prevents any movement.

In summary, these headphones are an excellent choice for users who want to immerse themselves in sound, whether for listening to music or making calls. They have exceptional battery life and offer clear, concise sound. I highly recommend them for any activity."
"Overall:
- Would highly recommend and would certainly purchase again. Very comfortable, great fit, fantastic sound out-of-box.

Pros:
- Product packaging includes 6 pairs of different-sized silicone earpieces.
- Earplug and case construction is solid. Not fancy or cheap.
- Comfortable and secure fit
- Out-of-box sound is exceptional at this price point. Bass is punchy, mids are scooped and don't sound muddy, and the high's are clear. You can download the free TOZO app to perform firmware updates and adjust EQ settings, but after comparing them to my studio monitor headphones, I elected to leave the TOZO T20's on the Standard EQ preset in the TOZO app. (For those interested, I achieve a flat frequency response on my studio monitor headphones by using the SonarWorks SoundID Reference app on my computer. This lets me compare the TOZO earbuds against the flat EQ of my headphones.)

Cons:
- Charging cable is short (less than 1ft)
- More color options, maybe? ...but even that said, just buy the earbuds. They're great!"
"I think Tozo products provide the best value on the market. The T20 earbuds are great. They provide exceptional sound quality, long battery life and are very comfortable even when worn for long periods of time.

I frequently travel cross country and have tried other earbuds to not only help pass the time but cut down on the noise. The T20 far surpasses other models I have tried. The battery life easily takes me coast to coast then, when necessary, quickly charge for another trip. One of the best feature for me is if I misplace them while traveling, I can easily replace them for a very reasonable price. I highly recommend the T20!"
"The sound quality is amazing! I originally bought these for work under my earmuffs, but I'd use these over my old headphones at home. I love the long battery life, and how it immediately connects to your bluetooth when you put them in. My wife's hates earbuds due to her having small ear canals. She tried these out and loves them! They are very functional and you can't beat the price. I would never spend over $50 on a pair of headphones, I'm so happy with the quality of this product."
"I've used Tozo earphones for a couple of years now and have been very happy with my experience each time, and these were no different. Sound quality, for the price you're paying, is very decent, with a healthy midrange and comparable bass. The charging case with specific charge percentage was a nice feature, it's hard to go back to another bud case after that.

I don't have extensive experience with many other products in this price range; the only competitor I've had a chance to use is JBL's wireless noise-cancelling earbud, and those are easily outclassed by the T20. The only letdown I've had with this model, compared to prior Tozo buds that I've owned, is the lack of an ""active"" noise-cancelling feature. These seem to have passive noise-cancelling, but I don't quite understand why they removed the active cancelling that existed in previous models of this bud. That's my only gripe, but the passive cancelling is still passable."
"My left earbud stopped functioning shortly after the return by date given after purchase. I reached out to TOZO after trying all of their troubleshooting steps and after providing a few details about my order, TOZO was able to resolve my issue. They replaced my order with a new set of earbuds. I'm satisfied with this resolution because they are a great pair of earbuds. Loud sound/Bass, no problems ever connecting to Bluetooth and I love the fact this pair can be charged wirelessly.
Good investment here imo. 😊"
"These are nice enough, but they aren't pass through and you won't be able to hear what's going on around you which was what I was hoping for with the headphones. That, and they seem to collect a lot of background data which is kind of weird and need your location or have the option to record your location which is weird and a bit unsettling, but you do have the option to keep it off"
"Headphones are amazing! They beat anything else in the price range and are just as good as air pods. I have tiny ear canals and the extra size ear plug part is the only reason these fit me. Being able to see the battery life of not only the charging case but the headphones too is huge, no more guessing when to charge them, no more dead headphones. Overall 8/10 cannot be beat at this price"
"Even though these lasted less than a year I was impressed by the customer service when I had told them that my earbuds no longer paired via Bluetooth and did multiple troubleshooting steps to ensure that it was useless.

I contacted them on their official website on 08/16 and received my replacement on 08/20.

I got introduced to the Tozo brand my someone gifting me the Tozo 10 and the Tozo 20 is definitely an upgrade. I appreciate their one year warranty when the error was outside of my return window and purchase protection from AMEX.

Thank you Tozo I appreciate the replacement!"
"Comfortable, Reliable, and Long-Lasting
I've been thoroughly impressed with my new earbuds. The fit is incredibly comfortable, and they stay securely in place even during workouts. The sound quality is crisp and clear, and I've had no issues with connectivity.

The feature I appreciate most is the long battery life. I can easily get through a full day of use without needing to recharge. Additionally, the percentage-based battery indicator is a nice touch, as it gives me a more precise idea of how much charge is left.

Overall, I'm highly satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend these earbuds to others."
"I had a new pair that I accidentally left in the pocket of my scrub top and threw the top in the wash. Darn! Of course neither bud worked when fresh out of the wash. With nothing to lose, I threw the buds back in my pocket and ran them through 3 or four drying cycles. What do you know, they started working again! I still use them today. Not sure my delicate expensive Apple ear buds would be quite so tenacious. Definitely five stars."
"The TOZO T20 Wireless Earbuds are an excellent choice for anyone seeking great sound quality. The bass is impressive, giving a rich and full audio experience, and they’re easy to connect right out of the box. The TOZO app allows for easy adjustments to suit your preferences, making it simple to fine-tune the sound. With 48.5 hours of playtime and an LED digital display to keep track of battery life, these earbuds are perfect for long listening sessions. Plus, their IPX8 waterproof rating adds peace of mind. To top it off, TOZO's customer service is friendly and responsive, making the whole experience even better."
"Great purchase. I love the convenience of this product, once I got it to sync with my phone it was ready to be used. I often have issues with the fit of earbuds, but these worked right away and stayed in place. A bunch of ear tips sets are part of the package placement sets for different ear sizes. 
I have not run with them, but used them in the gym, for business calls and casual listening. The sound is clear and crisp, the microphone is very good and sensitive. The noise cancelling especially during calls is fantastic. The battery life is very long. I have used them for about one hour every day and haven’t had to charge them yet after 2 weeks in."
So in 2021 I bought the t6 earbuds and have worn them every day all day since and loved the sound. Recently they started to mess up so I decided to buy tozo again. Saw these and liked the app part but was pensive about the sound quality since the t10 ones my dad had were kind of lacking in sound quality far ass bass goes but I decided to give them a shot. Right out of the box I set them up using the equalizer in the app for bass+ because I like bass in my music. Man I have to say the sound quality for music with that setup is unbelievably nice. My old lady even asked for a pair because she loves the fit and the sound. Because I wear 1 at work always I am ordering some memory foam replacement tips so they won’t fall out while I’m sweating at work. Or should I say the gym since my job works me out like the gym. Far as battery life and other stuff we shall see how that goes. Right now I’m tired from work and going to relax and watch a movie on my phone and see how they sound for that.
A quality set of earbuds for everyday listening for the price. Fit and comfort is great and provides enough of a seal to keep most outside distractions at bay even though they are not a noise canceling set. I find the sound quality better than the previous T12s I have owned and they seem to be clearer on calls for others as well. Tozo customer service is quick to respond through the Tozu app. Very satisfied with their products and support.
"A nicely designed product by Tozo. Unlike the T6 or the A1, this T20 earbud is shaped a little bit like the Airpod. It curves on the main piece and has a long stem. The earbud fits snugly on my ear and it does not seem that it would fall off very easily. The package comes with a charging case, a short USB-A to USB-C cable (a little more than 6 in), and 5 pairs of additional different sizes of rubber pieces. The USB-C goes to the back of the case for charging. The charging case has an LED light showing the battery life and charging indicator.

Overall I think this is a great product for those who look for affordable, good quality of earbud. When I purchase it, there was also a $6 coupon that you can pick before checking out."
"I have been using Tozo for a few years now, and so far I've been quite impressed. Especially with the T20 series.
I appreciate how durable they are, and I like the indicator on the charger. I knowing its a small detail but it's nice to see an accurate indicator that tells me how long my ear buds will last.
If I had a gripe though, it's that the bass isn't as prominent on many songs. Like it's fine, as if your listening to a standard car sound system without touching the equalizer. But besides that, I love it."
"1 is higher then the other, 1 of my ear-holes are bigger then the other, each inner shape is unique so I've always struggled with fit.

These for perfect! I wore 1 for 8 hours straight today with no ear fatigue and actually forgetting I had then in.
I can't fit apple ear Buds they always fall out of me ear. These feel so secure when in!
The sound is TOZO at its best with customized equalizer settings in the app.
Headphone makers also usually make you pick from 1 of 2 colors, usually black or white... but I purchased mine in red and they look luxurious.
The cherry on top (red reference) is the digital screen that shows you battery percentage and more sprinkles= wireless charging! Tozo T20 are great!"
"I previously went with a pair of JBLs and after, I believe it was, 2 weeks the battery would no longer hold a charge. I just saw them and previously had a jbl speaker that did ok but returned those and saw these. The charge on these is insanely good. I only use them every other day for about 2 hours but the case charge is just now at 50%. They fit particularly well in the ear too, the pivot of the sound bud into the ear gives a great fit and no discomfort. I'm very happy with these"
"I love these! I must have 10 or 12 sets of BT earbuds. All ‘inexpensive’….while I do have an Iphone, iPad & Apple Watch, I’m not spending hundreds on earbuds. So I watch the specials on Amazon and I’ve stumbled on some excellent buds & excellent sellers! These sound great, feel great, etc.
These are so comfy, I forget I have them in, like, I’ll leave my apt, go down the elevator, they’ll d/c and then reconnect when I walk back in my apt. I had been looking for something I could sleep in, but sadly, these aren’t them. If I lie down and if my ear bends , it’ll touch the controls in that ear & screw up the volume or something, so these are my daytime TV buds. I just bought a second set (in red), so they’re ready to replace these as soon as they need charging.
Can’t take a photo as I’m wearing them, but will try to grab a snap when I swap them out for the red ones. I’m actually not sure how long they’ll play, they were in the case charging, I put them in at about 730am, it’s almost noon and they’re still going strong (edit: they were still going at 3pm)
I use them for BT connecting to my phone or tv (and my 47” flatscreen tv is over 13yrs old & didn’t come w BT built in, I connected a BT transmitter, it’s EZ!). I use these as TV buds. Silent home. My neighbors don’t need to hear what I’m watching or listening to…..and yeah, it’s also bc I hate thinking I’m disturbing a neighbor. Lived in my own house until a few yrs ago, now I’m in a big apt complex with ‘who knows’ for neighbors."
"The earbuds have impressive audio quality. Nicely fitting and sleek as well. Lightweight and easy fitting compared to their T9 version.

Only feature I found missing was the ability to connect more than one device at a time. I am having to disconnect one device before attempting to connect to a second device. Easier option would have been just hitting ’Connect’ from second device which should switch the devices automatically. Hope they bring that feature in their future versions."
"These earbuds are fantastic! They come with multiple ear tips to fit both large and small ears, which is a nice touch. The sound quality is excellent, and the battery life is impressive. My old rechargeable wired ones only lasted a couple of hours, but with these, I've used them for about 8 hours over a few days, and the battery is still at 85%. I'm confident they could easily last several more days of regular use without any issues."
"I had a set of more expensive headphones, but I lost them. I don’t like to walk around with expensive headphones anyways as I’m afraid to lose them

I had an earlier version of this product and really enjoyed the product at its price point. This new version is great and they really made it look a lot sleeker and smaller while maintaining the sound quality. It easy to use and setup. The tozo app, gives you better control of your earbuds. You can change you equalizer to your liking. Performance has been great."
"The T20 earbuds are the 4th product by TOZO that I've owned. I’ve learned to never worry about whether or not I'm going to like them while I'm waiting for them to be delivered.

I also have a pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 2, but I use my TOZO buds alot more because the battery life lasts so much longer for the TOZO.

Also, here's a tip that some may find useful. I like to use foam tips on all my earbuds to block outside noise. I like to use the Comply Truegrip Pro premium tips. I first bought them to use with my galaxy buds because that's what they're made for, but I also realized that they fit all of my TOZO buds perfectly, as well!"
"Ive been using these for a couple of months now. I prefer more bass than they provide but I have to say the charge stays forever. They fit in my ear fairly, havent fell out yet, always pairs to my iphone and works without hiccups. Not sure that i would like them as much if I listened to music all day (bass issue) but I listen to a lot of podcasts and theyre perfect for the price."
"I had the T10s for several years and saw they had an upgrade. I like how you can know the charge level on the case as well as individual headphones. (Can see pictures other people posted) There has been a few times where it did not want to auto connect to my phone, but that’s not normally the case. Great headphones and good sound quality. I like how I can charge it on a cordless charger and that it comes with several sizes to match fit for different ear sizes.

My one downside is the controls are a bit wonky. But that’s only because I’m used to T10s and the T20s are different.

TLDR: great headphones for great prices."
"Perhaps it is the style. I am not accustomed to these and had to use ear inserts from an old TOZO to make them usable. Simply did not fit with anything in the kit. I hope they last as long as my old ones, and I hope I get used to them.

Is there a world where these earbuds do not have touch sensing ability? Like when wearing a hoody or a hat that touches the sensor and does volume changes and even pause, FF, RW, all on behalf of the headgear. Is there some unusual method to turn off all touch sensor features? Let the device do the heavy lifting here. Still love TOZO.
PS, with the old-style inserts, these were not fitting into the charger. Removal every charge would be necessary, I modified the plastic charging case by shaping the space between the bud seats to accommodate these older style inserts on these buds. Perhaps someone might please look at this? Still love TOZO, you left me enough material there, leave a bit more and we can both be happy? It now charges well with these improved inserts, and I did not hit any vital organs. LOL"
"I just upgraded from tozo a2 headphones, and it's the first time I stuck with a brand through headphone changes. My other ones still work great too. These have good sound, they're convenient to use (you can use one at a time) and they're cheap too. I also just learned you can connect them to the app and change eq settings. Awesome headphones, would buy again!"
"What can I say? With the earbud market flooded with over priced junk I decided to give these bad boys a try and have been loving them! I recently lost my first pair while at work and bought a new pair right away. Not only did I get it quickly but I got even cheaper then when I first bought them with a coupon Amazon was giving away. The main reasons I love these earbuds is because they last all day, charge quickly, work efficiently along with a strong Bluetooth connection all while being super easy to use. It's a great fit for my ears aiding with decent noise cancellation for a proper sound."
"I've purchased multiple TOZO earbuds sets over the years and have enjoyed how well they work and their value. Recently I did have a warrantable concern with a set of T21s I purchased and contacted TOZO directly for assistance. Their team was quick to respond and had me try some troubleshooting in order to rule out user error or a one-time glitch. In this case the T21s were unfortunately unable to be revived. TOZO offered up a set of T20s at no charge which I did receive and have been very happy with since. It's unavoidable to have periodic product failures or issues but it's how the company responds to these concerns that makes or breaks a customer's experience. In TOZO's case, they responded appropriately, timely and stood behind their product; quickly and completely addressing the situation. I continue to remain a happy customer and will continue to purchase TOZO products moving forward."
"I had airpods a while ago, and one of them got run over. Since then, I've been trying to find some that are comparable, but for a fraction of the price. These are it. They fit well, the quality of sound is great, and anytime I'm talking on the phone, the person on the other side doesn't pick up extra background noise. I can even vacuum without it being too loud for them. Definitely recommend these."
"If you’re looking for a low cost and quality earphone, this is it. I had the TOZO T6 originally and lost them but loved them. Fortunately the price point made them really easy to replace. wanted to try these because they were a little cheaper on sale and had the digital battery display. Within about 5 minutes the case went from 98 to 91% battery, so not expecting loads of listening time. But again, for the price point, I feel like these are the best you can get.

Edit to add from 10pm to 10am, while they were just sitting on my counter, the case went from 91% to 56%. Not sure if this is normal but this seems like an odd jump for unused earphones"
"I've another set of Tozo ear buds and I wore them out! They provide clear, balanced sound while the noise cancellation does it's job well! I used these primarily in my office to either listen music or block out the chatter! No need to get a more expensive brand. These fit the bill!"
"I got these on sale for about $25, and at that price they're a steal. They sound very good, fit better than most of the older models that I have tried, and the app lets you customize the touch functions and EQ. As a bonus, I love the shade of green these come in."
This is my first set of earbuds so I wasn’t sure how they would work or how the sound would be. But I tried them the night I got them and so far I am pleased with the sound quality. Not sure if they are the best but I’m satisfied
"Comfortable, Great sound, Holds the charge for a long time, Battery-life display on charging case is awesome, and what I love best about the earbuds is that they came with SIX different sized earbud rubber caps which is necessary for a perfect fit and to be truly noise canceling! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!"
"So far, I’m liking the product and I like the price even better. I think it’s great to try especially when it being on special. The sound quality is great and people can hear me. My Volume is great as well"
"Great sound for the price. Build quality is what you would expect. I use them as secondary headphones when I need them in a pinch. Touch controls are a bit finicky but likely like most of this product and price. For example, pushing the headphonen back in my ear paused, the music. I still need to figure out how best to use the touch controls, until then I'll stick to controlling with my iPhone and Apple Watch. [Note: sent to me for review]"
"Normally, when you spent 26 dollars on earbuds you think to yourself “well these aren’t going to offer you much” but boy you are wrong once you open the box and use the app. I was also surprised by how many ear tips you get especially if you have large ears the sound is amazing and customizable with the eq settings my phone and tablet were able to connect right away! I’m a happy customer and I’ll keep buying from TOZO more often"
"This was a really good investment. I like that the product is reasonable priced for such good quality. I'm very active, so I tend to be rough with my earbuds and headphones. I have done a lot of heavy sweating and I have taken a shower with these buds since my purchase (approx 3 weeks ago). No damage. I didn't read that the product is water proof, so I wouldn't get in the pool, but they seem to have good water/moisture resistance. Even if I did damage them, they are so reasonably priced that I would replace with another pair 🙂."
"The TOZO T20 earbuds offer excellent value for their price, combining premium features like wireless charging, great sound, and long battery life into a sleek package. They are a fantastic choice for anyone looking for quality wireless earbuds without breaking the bank."
I lost my Samsung earbuds so I decided to get a cheaper replacement. These are surprisingly good. There is no settings for the noise cancelation though like the Samsung earbuds. Disappointing.
"So I just got these out of the box and charged up and am taking them for a test drive and the sound is amazing! The bass is thumping. The highs are crisp and clean. The mid-range sounds are full. These things sound wonderful.

I will have to get back to you on battery life and the ease of use for the tozo app.

But out of the box so far it's a win!"
"I have used many different Bluetooth buds and headsets including some very expensive ones. This is my second set of the T20s, I lost the other set. I've been doing rehab work for a hip replacement by walking in a swimming pool. I went thru several different ones that were presented as waterproof but sadly not so much. When I get into the pool, I usually drop down into the water to get completely wet. While the Bluetooth signal does drop out under water they do come back on when my head gets above the water. I have a several pairs of some fairly expensive buds that are not waterproof and don't sound any better than theses. The only thing, be sure to fit the cushion that goes into your ear to fit properly. That makes lots of difference in the sound quality. They have a great warranty and are a great value."
"I enjoyed my first set of Tozo earbuds, but the sound had faded on the left side and they stopped charging. I felt I got my money’s worth and am trying the T20. Sound is superior on a first try. I’ve had them less than an hour, but all seems good. I love that they have different ear piece sizes—I need xsmall, which I feel is hard to find, but I didn’t spend a lot of time looking; I talked to people instead. The touch works much like the other pair—tried it al and it responds to a delicate touch. Says you can voice activate. I haven’t tried that yet. I expect they’ll work just fine and serve my purposes. Rating is completely based on ease of use upon arrival and immediate sound quality. I can’t rate durability or longevity, obviously."
"I've been using this pair as a secondary device and it has done what I wanted them to do.
Decent noise cancelling and sound quality. It also shows you the percentage of charge, so that is a nice little feature."
"It’s very rare that i make time to leave a product review, single dad and working 50 hours wk etc….
I’ve used all of, if not most , the major brands $$$ and this lil drops of heaven have brought me more enjoyment from the amazing sound quality, the durability and the top notch customer service experience i will only be using Tozo headphones moving forward. The first set i bought were the T6. I live on the beach and like to work out and run near salt water so it’s easy to see why most headphones ive used couldn’t hold up to the wear and tare of water, sand and sweat… Tozo came through as best customer service and support. After a year i had a little sound distortion and one side would occasionally not charge ( probably because of dirty connections after the fact) i figured id just check to see if the headphones had a warranty?
come to find out didn’t have a warranty, just expired, they said they would honor the product and replace the headphones making exception!!!
They are rock solid and now have the T6, the T10, and T20’s and they all get used for different reasons but i will only use Tozo after all that!"
"I was on the hunt for high-value earbuds to gift to friends and came across the Tozo brand. For such an affordable price, these earbuds offer impressive features. They come with a wireless charging case, IPX8 waterproof rating, and a robust 48.5-hour playtime. The dual mic noise-cancelling and 10mm speakers deliver great sound quality, and the LED display is a nice touch. Overall, Tozo provides exceptional value for money, making these earbuds a fantastic gift choice."
"one of the earbuds quit on me after a few days of use. dealing with their customer service was very straightforward. they asked a couple of relevant questions and had a new pair in the mail very quickly. no language barrier. they were actually better to deal with than Amazons customer service.
They have a good range and long battery life. equal range and better battery life than my apple AirPods.
I'd buy them again, no regrets."
"Simple as that.
Sound quality 4/5 - took off a point here because there's a high frequency electronic sound that the left earbud sometimes makes. It's like a ""beep beep boop"" sound that doesn't impact the music being played but can be heard in junction with it. Infrequent and modestly noticeable.

Sound delivery 6/5 - as distinct from sound quality, this mens how much time from when I remove each earbud from the case do I need to spend getting it to produce sound. This includes Bluetooth connectivity, pairing with one another, durability of the case's charging pins, etc. Basically I just want it to make sound. These are the best headphones I have ever owned on the basis of do they work when you want them to. Separately or together....
Battery life- 4/5 About 3-5 hours. Haven't really timed it out, but if you bring the case with you, it's hard to outrun the battery.
Fit- 4/5 They fall out sometimes when I'm doing burpees or shooting jumpers.
Charging case 5/5 - weighty and durable. Led screen shows charge % and confirms charging status.

For the price, 5/5. I didn't buy air pods on purpose, and it's these!!!"
"Love that these are IPX8 waterproof, have been using them daily including in the sauna and have not had any issues whatsoever. Considered other brands of wireless earbuds but the value and water resistance could not be beat!"
"I bought these to replace an aging pair of wireless earbuds. What an improvement! Not only can I hear better, the people I am calling say I sound much better. I am buying a second set to have on hand."
"The delivery, packaging , the quality of plastic is amazing for 19$. These sound good and I am yet to test out the functionality fully, but I am sure this will hold good for at least 2 years."
I am really enjoying these earbuds. They offer solid audio quality and ANC. Call quality is also good and the case with the built-in display is nice to use. Knowing the charge when I open the case is so nice!
"The new TOZO T20 are awesome. TOZO keeps integrating cool new features and technology into each iteration of their earbud products and the new optical battery life is super convenient in eliminating the guess work of how much battery life I have left. The wireless charging also allows me to set them down on their TOZO W1 wireless charging plate and they're charged and ready when I'm ready to use them again. The charging plate also works with my phone, eliminating the need to keep a charging cable readily available."
"This is a really good set of headphones, and the company itself is very communicative and responsive. I've used TOZO's NC9's for almost a year until I lost one of the buds :(

I will miss the active noise cancellation but these headphones are just as clear in terms of quality, and the ENC definitely helps during phone calls. Controls are very simple, just tap the earbud, though that does cause some types of issues when you're just trying to adjust it. Comes with many different sizes of earbuds so they'll fit everybody.

All in all just a great company with great headphones for good prices. 💯"
T20’s are always my go-to headphones. They feel good and audio quality is great! Looks pretty good—they aren’t Apple Headphones but the only thing that makes Apple headphones stand out are a slightly better audio and better features which aren’t very necessary. Connects fast and very easy—I have like 3 pairs already because I can’t get enough of them. Cheap in terms of price but don’t let that fool you—they are amazing headphones!
"Tozo is the best , been a client for ~5yrs. I have 8 ear buds, different version and style and colors . I have 1 pegged to each of my devices. (Tablet, phone, mac, pc, hubbys phone, his tablet,
My Ipad) Even have them at my work. I buy these for gifts. Folks love them.
So easy to pair. I use for zoom video calls and audio is perfect hearing and speaking.

I love the variety of colors. Makes it easy to identify."
"I bought these earbuds back in November of 2023. I use them everyday for about an hour or more depending on what I am doing. Recently I noticed that the left earbud wouldn’t hold a charge longer than 45 min. I tried to troubleshoot it but ended up contacting the company via customer service. I tried doing the Troubleshooting suggestions they gave me, but it still didn’t fix the problem. Now they are sending me a new pair of earbuds at no cost to me. I appreciate them giving me a new pair and I have been very happy with the earbuds up to this point. They are comfortable and you can hear people clearly on Phone call conversations. I have bought Tozo Earbuds before and been satisfied. I will continue to buy from this company."
"Company's customer service is awesome! This model, the T20 works well, however I much prefer the NC2, for its superb sound quality and excellent noise cancellation features."
"These earbuds sound great, fit well with the different sizes of plastic buds and have a good battery life. I've bought 3 pairs and they all work flawlessly. I highly recommend them and the price is incredible!"
"Have had a number of Tozo Earbuds over the years and these are solid. They are comfortable, stable in your ears. Good sound quality with factory set ""flat"" equalization curve (more on this later). Good solid charging case but surprise...surprise! for the first time the orientation of the earbuds to the case is correct so you don't have to sprain your wrist tweeking it to put the earbuds back in the charging case. The Tozo app is fantastic and allows you to use varied frequency equalization curves to get the sound the way you want it or you can customize your own frequency curve. Battery life is good and charging the case can be done either with a USB C cord or wirelessly. Great value."
"I've been using these for about a week now and am thoroughly impressed. The battery life gets me through an entire day of work and the quality is just as good as other expensive brands I've tried in the past. The case is nice and compact, so you can easily carry it in your pocket. It's also nice that you can check the battery capacity from the readout on the case. They seem to be made of quality materials, and for the price, you definitely can't go wrong with these earbuds."
So small and adorable I love this purchase and it Came with charger since I was in a hurry all I have to do it connected it and I’m good to go and it charged very fast.
Great sound. I really like these ear buds. After about a year I started having issues with them holding a charge. I reached out to customer service and they have been super helpful. I would still recommend these
"Was looking for a budget pair of earbuds to use outdoors in all sort of weather. Decent sound quality. Comes with several different sizes of ear tips. Take the time to try all the sizes to find best fit. A good tight fit will improve the bass response. These buds do not have noise cancelling. That was not a concern as I want to be able to hear ambient sounds/traffic when walking in my neighborhood. Battery life is outstanding and I like that you can recharge them in the case without a power hookup. Overall, decent sound and a great value."
"I’ve been using the T6 for years now. I always had an issue with them falling out of my ear, but I still loved them. I gave my daughter the T6s and upgraded myself to the T20s. I really enjoy them. I can wear them all day and they’ll stay put. The audio and touch sensors are pretty much the same. T6 was more sensitive to touch though. I would buy these again if needed."
"Tl;dr - Here’s what you probably came here to find out:

- Sound quality is phenomenal. Deep bass and rich crystal clear highs. Hands down better than AirPods Pro 2, and significantly so imo.

- Battery life is the longest I’ve ever experienced, once again shaming Apple.

- Noise cancelling is great. For this, I’d say it’s equal to AirPods Pro 2, if not slightly better.

- They fit very snugly in my ears and don’t fall out with movement. They come with three pairs of ear tips, each a different size.

- Very good construction and premium feel. They also look really good.

- The charging case can either be charged with a type-C wire, or on any wireless charger by laying them down on the charging pad.

- The Skullcandy IQ app is actually useful with features such as custom EQ, voice control configuration, ANC controls, etc.

Long version:

Borrowed my Wife’s AirPods Pro 2 off and on for a week before deciding to give these a go as they were 50% off, and as someone who listens to metal and hard rock, these things absolutely murder Apple’s flagship buds. As far as sound quality and loudness, going from the AirPods Pro 2 to these was like going from ramen noodles to premium ribeye. The bass is right where it should be, and the treble is crystal clear and clean. Loud is an understatement. I use Spotify Premium and am happy with the EQ within that app, but the EQ within the Skullcandy app is really great as well. These are made well and feel great. Battery is roughly 6-7 hours, so really great. They fit great, are very comfortable, and don’t fall out with movement. All in all, these buds are amazing. Apple can’t compete."
"I love the volume and Bass on these guys. The different size tips are perfect..well for me they are, they stay in my ears no matter what I'm doing , the app is helpful. The equalizer is awesome. I'd love louder, but that's just my preference, I want it to rattle my brain literally, they're loud, don't get me wrong. Only dislike, more of a little annoyance is, they're very touchy, it's not a deal breaker, I've gotten used to it already. They last all day as far as battery, my right seems to ALWAYS drain quicker, it's weird, but again, not a deal breaker. I will honestly say, I've tried so many brands, and skullcandy is just IT , every aspect, skullcandy is IT. Keep it up skullcandy , great job. Can't wait to see what's next."
"Are they comparable to some of the top brands? If you consider price, they may be better. My previous buds include Bose and Samsung so this is the basis for my comparison. Pairing was uneventful and the Skull IQ app is easy to use. ANC and Stay Aware feature work as advertised. Fit is comfortable and secure. Audio is more than acceptable; especially is you use the Skull IQ app to customize the sound as well as the included hearing test portion of the app to create a personalized profile. For those that suggest there is not enough bass, I recommend using the app to customize the sound and make sure that the buds are tightly fitted. I would buy them again for the price I paid (not sure why but my price was 49.88 new). Might shop harder at the $89 current price."
"Edit: added more at the end

If you had an allergic reaction to Samsung Buds 2 or their other earbuds, you'll react to these as well. I wore the Rail ANC for less than one afternoon and by dinner my ears were already reacting with liquid discharge. This morning at 4am I had one ear almost totally crusted over and still leaking while the other was leaking but less crusted. I've had this reaction before and I suspect it's the material used for the inserts. Also, the little logo they put on them didn't help either. Anything that causes friction in the ear canal is a stupid idea. I got these for a trip I'm taking on a plane across country and I'm kinda screwed now because I can't return them in time to get something else. My old wired headphones from when I bought my Samsung pgone don't react, so I took those ear inserts and luckily they fit, so I through them on. Once my ears stop reacting and chill out, I'll see if that fixes the issue in time for my trip.

As far as function goes, the headphones are okay at best. They can get plenty loud to the point that ANC or their Stay Aware pass through mode mean nothing. It's nice to know I can listen at lower volumes like I prefer and still have ambient noise be mostly audible or have anc keep things subdued. But subdued is the best they give and mostly audible ambient noise is about as much as you can expect. These aren't stellar at either. Doable, but not something I'd laude about.

They sound pretty good for what they are. Not sure if I'd say they're $100 headphone quality or value, allergies aside, but they don't sound awful by any means. Music was clear and had some rumble. I used the sound personalization and it was easy enough to get decent sound. There a bass boost, general music and podcast sound setting with a customizable equalizer in the app as well.

The buttons on the side are touch activated and finicky. I tend to tap fast and expect fast responses, but these prefer a more methodical pace. The sweetspot for where to touch is also funky, but I started getting it after a few hours. Also, the audio queues are clear enough, but an option to remove them would make things feel faster. Also, if they're not in my ear, I wish touch capacity stopped. Plenty of time I took one out and accidentally started changing tracks, changing volume and activating pairing mode.

I remapped all the touch responses and even changed what ear did what. One tap on either paused, double tap on left was volume down, on right it's volume up. Three taps left was previous track and same on the right was skip ahead. Long press in either toggles ANC on/off and pass through audio. I appreciate customization like that.

For what stands out as good, I'd say it's the voice prompts. Much quicker to respond than on my phone or watch and that's kinda sad because it's the feature I'll probably never use and cared rhe least about, but seemed so much better than my phones inbuilt assistant that Samsung spent so much time, effort and money on to develop (rip bixby). If you like using voice commands, that's gonna go great, although the ""take photo"" command doesn't work with my Samsung's camera app. Again, not something I was after anyways.

One of my favorite features was the built-in tile function for finding them if I lose one or both. The tile app isn't super intuitive, but I mostly figured it out and stumbled my way into it connecting both buds. It creates a tone I can hear when the room in my apartment is silent and has a directional sensor to let me know if I'm getting hotter or colder. Granted, it's not terribly responsive, sensitive or consistent, but if I moved slowly through a room, I bet between the proximity sensor and sound I'd probably find one if I lost one. It's a nice feature to have where I'd otherwise be totally screwed, so I'll take a win where I can with these.

I got these on pre-order. When they were scheduled to release after 2 weeks, they ended up coming 10 days earlier or less. It seems weird i had to pre-order when people said they were already at Walmart for a couple weeks, but whatever.

I'll update after my ears recover and try them using the non-reactive ear inserts from my old wired heaphones and see if they don't react again. I was furious about my Galaxy Buds 2 causing this reaction, but my wired stuff and my LG Tone Platinums never caused an issue. If it weren't summer and the LG Tone Platinums weren't makeing my neck hot, I might never have bothered looking at this style Bluetooth buds again. But it's a trip to a Nevada training center after the hottest july month on record in human history with averages around 110 in the area I'll be. I thought I'd take a chance on mild comfort. I'm hoping I didn't waste my money now that almost out of time.

EDIT: It's been a few days so I'll add more input. Battery is pretty good, but it's not enough to bump a star.

The app Skullcandy IQ is awful. It's what controls your key presses. The problem is the app is always on, but loses connection and resets all your programmed key presses. I end up having to reset them every day when they eventually connect poorly. The app logo constantly in my phones notification bar isn't necessary or tell me any input about my headphones. If it at least told me battery levels or connection status, maybe I wouldn't be so annoyed, but this just ISN'T ready for prime time.

Also, the ear inserts are what caused the allergic reaction. They jerryrigged replacements I found by chance from a totally different set of wired buds from an old phone work well enough, but I shouldn't have to find my own replacements. At least having an option for different inserts that are non-reactive would be beneficial like memory foam or whatever. Again, Samsung Buds 2 had this EXACT issue and replacing inserts with an aftermarket set was the only solution. For a list of symptoms, it's pretty unmistakable: liquid discharge, discolored mucousal discharge in ear, weeping ear, flaking and scaly skim that seems to build up and shed, pain itching, inflammation, basically a large skin irritation in your ear canal that, if unmanaged, becomes a severe ear infection. Samsung got sued for it and has been paying out for their affected customers. Skullcandy is headed the same way with these unless they have a hypoallergenic replacement in the wing.

If the connectivity issue wasn't so bad and not saving my preset remapped button setting wasn't so annoying, perhaps I would add a star or two, but this isn't ready for release and I'm probably returning after giving another day or two. Really sucks I'm screwed out of my trip for headphones, but I'm not gonna struggle with a new set of buds I paid good money for. I'll just go back to wired at this point."
"Normally my reviews are very short and to the point however this one's going to be a little bit longer. I didn't think that these would actually be worth it but in fact they are. There are extremely many features that are missing on very expensive earbuds. And I'm talking the big brands...

First I'll tell you that when you do set up with the app a hearing test it actually does work it helps greatly especially if ones hearing isn't what it used to be. Secondly, as with most, you can set your equalizer to your own personal settings if you want to. The sound, or music, actually doesn't sound awful again I was a bit surprised. Now another thing that is usually a problem for me just keeping my buds in my ears at all times. Well please actually stay in perfectly and they don't hurt one bit and that's using them for at least 9 hours in a row without taking them out. The battery life as far as I know it looks like it might be pretty good unfortunately I haven't given it enough time to judge that but by the usage I have had with the buds they seem to hold up relatively well with ambient on. Basically I'm very satisfied with these I will keep them and hope that they do keep them updated as they should when needed.

Now one con is the app is a pain in the butt. It has to always know you're nearby settings it always ask you to have Bluetooth on, which is already on and the buds are already connected before you get into the app. I don't get that one maybe they'll fix it and the other which is unfortunately the case. The case is a bit flimsy and when you want to try to keep the lid open it keeps falling down so I think that that was a architectural design flaw other than that they're definitely worth it I'll get over the case problem all I have to say is if you want them you'll be happy with them. Used with an Android device."
"I have long been a fan of Skullcandy headphones and earbuds, at least 10 - 15 years. The earbuds were always decent and sturdy, even if you got cheaper ones.

My last pair of true wireless earbuds were the Skullcandy Indy earbuds, and I was so sorry to see these were no longer being made.

But I was looking forward to the Rail ANC earbuds. First, ANC! Second, a decent IPX4. Third, great battery life. Plus, they cost more, so they must be higher quality, right? So I splurged a little on June 28, 2024. These earbuds sound pretty good. I can tell only a minor difference when the ANC is on and when it's off. The passthrough mode is okay, maybe about as good as the Indy's. The battery life was amazing. That's right. Was. We'll get to that. I loved using the app SkullIQ, where you can customize control settings. I was able to change what the number of taps on the sensor does. Super cool!

My list of gripes as of 8/23/2024.

First of all, how did my right earbud stop working within the first month? There's a sound when you press the sensor. Within 2 weeks, it started randomly making the sensor pressing sound. Then it started saying Pairing... pairing... as if I was doing long single presses. Then it started skipping to the next track(triple press) and trying to start Spotify* (double press). Within the first month it just wouldn't power on at all. I tried all the tricks and worked with Skullcandy support to no avail. They suggested I submit a warranty claim.

*Sidenote: how does it fail to open Spotify whether I'm listening to Spotify or not?).

Sometimes they will connect to my phone even thought they are in their case and should be off. My Indy's would do this, too, but it took at least a year or two before that started. This started within the first two months.

Every once in a while they wont even connect and you will have to go to settings, forget device, then pair them to your phone again. This is what Skullcandy support had me try to fix the right earbud. Occasionally I need to do this on the left earbud as well. Well if you do this, you have to customize the SkullIQ app again.

The case is cheap. My Indy's case was solid and sturdy. It had a few LEDs to indicate how much battery life was left in the case. This new one is flimsy with one light that shows you if the battery is being charged or not.

Lastly, the Indy's stayed in my ears much better than the Rail's do. So I'm constantly needing to readjust them in my ears. With a name like Rail, I figured it was made for an active lifestyle. I wash windows for a living, but these things don't stay in my ears too well.

As of today, they are in the mail headed to San Diego for the warranty claim. Hopefully, I get a somewhat better product when it's returned."
"I've had lots of ear buds, these are by far one of the best! They hold a charge foe a long time, comfortable in your ear, performance is great, charges fast, very durable and sound is stability. Great value for the money."
"I previously owned the Skullcandy dime2 earbuds, but I was having to charge them every few days. With these earbuds, the battery life lasts considerably longer saving me from having to charge them constantly. The case is very sturdy and the noise cancellation is superb. Because of the sound quality and noise cancellation I can listen to music in a noisy gym without having to crank the volume way up. I am glad I spent the extra money on these rather than getting the dime 2 earbuds again."
"Im gonna keep it short and simple. When i got them price was great and the sound quality is also great lowk. Only thing that should be better is the ANC because I tried them on and off and theres barely a difference in loud or quiet areas. It really just mutes background noise like air conditioning or something small. Either than that they are really good.

Also i’ve had airpods pro 2 and to me the ANC to them are way better than the Rails but the for the price difference its understandable"
"Love these headphones, they work great and the ANC helps a lot when I need to focus, affordable price too, my only gripe would be they can get a bit uncomfortably wearing them for extended periods of time seeing how they aren’t exactly breathable"
"These earbuds are great, they have a long battery life, are comfortable with good sound. I've yet to find a pair of these that will stay in my ear completely but these stay in longer than any others I've had. Skull candy makes great products and for the cost you can't beat these."
Every now and then the Bluetooth would forget the device gets kinda annoying besides that they sound great!
"Have had many different Skullcandy earbuds and these are the best so far. Very comfortable and the sound is really good. Disappointed that they use a different app to mange then the previous models and that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

I love the fact that you can pair to 2 devices at once. I use this at work and can pair to my work laptop and my phone at the same time. Really love that feature. Battery life is good and the case isn't overly big and easy to carry in your pocket."
"I've had these for a while now > 6 months. I have to say that the ANC feature doesn't work at all. I've had other ANC offerings from other manufacturers and this doesn't block outside noises at all. I have a set of Skullcandy Grind (non ANC) and the noise suppression enjoyed by the ear canal seal works as good or better than this ANC.
I have had numerous Skullcandy earbuds and like the brand and most of their earbuds offer a nice sound for a fair price, except this one. Also, I have this set paired with my iPhone and my Windows 10 Laptop, the iPhone app is the only way to control the features of the Rail detailed features, I wish there were a windows app.
Bottom line is if you are looking for an ANC earbud, look elsewhere. Skullcandy offers a nice variety of fair priced other earbuds, but not these. At least my $0.02."
"Llevo poco más de un mes usando los audífonos y han funcionado muy bien. Los utilizo para hacer ejercicio y trotar y permanecen bien sujetos al oído, no se caen. El sonido está muy bien y el control por vos facilita mucho su manejo. Son livianos y su batería también tiene muy buena duración."
"The sound is what you would expect from Skullcandy, really bass heavy, which I enjoy. I like being able to use the Skullcandy app with these earbuds. With the app you can change the equalizer, switch sound modes, and customize the touch functions. I also like The voice control function. The only thing that I have a slight problem with is the fit. I use these headphones while I work and as I get sweaty they start to slip out a little bit and I have to stop and readjust. But other than that I really enjoy these headphones"
"After trying these out for a month I have decided that I don't particularly enjoy the product. They do sound great but the caveat is the reliability in pairing.

The pros:
Great sound, awesome EQ options, the app allows a bunch of personal customization settings that I did enjoy.

The cons:
The gesture button is smack dab on the rear of the headphone driver. When I would push in the headphones to secure them in my ear better, while listening to them or on the phone, I would always pause/hang up on accident.
The EQ settings stay the same for both music and phone calls. I like some bass in my music.. but not so much on my phone calls.
By far the killer of this product is the amount of times I had to re-pair the headphones to my phone. It is very inconvenient to do especially when I am in a rush and need to make a call.

I'm always on the go, and rely on headphones heavily for entertainment and business. For a casual user these buds are great. But they are not good a good workhorse product."
bought it as a gift for my brother. he liked it. but from my perspective it feels a bit cheap. the plastic body seems very undurable
Sounds cool like their previous earbuds but as the previous the main downside is that they fall off a bit to easy for me no matter what eartip I use provided in the package.
"They are perfect! I really love that you can customize what you want tapping each earned to mean. Like skip a song, volume, pause, all of it. It's so helpful! LOVE these!"
I am a big fan of the Skullcandy brand. I was very happy with the purchase price and how easy they were to connect- and even charge with my charging pad. Very pleased with the overall range.
"I had skull candy headphones as a kid, and loved them. Granted, this is back when headphones still physically plugged into a device or phone. So when I saw these I was super excited. Unfortunately, they ended up being the LEAST enjoyable earbud I have purchased, yet. Before you read further, it is worth noting that a lot of people are super satisfied with these earbuds, so it is extremely likely that this is more about my user preferences not matching with the specs of the item. That being said, the following are the agitations and the positives I’ve experienced since using them:

THE CONS:
• The earbuds regularly don’t sync with my phone & I am prompted at least 3x a week to “forget” the earbuds and then go through the pairing process again. Not a huge problem, but a mild inconvenience made worse by the regularity in which it happens.
• The earbuds fall out of my ears from my jaw moving, which happens often, because my jaw moves when I talk on the phone.
• The earbuds require an app to be downloaded to my phone, in order to customize each button sequence to the desired function (I.e. answer phone, play music, skip forward, etc.). The frustration I have with this is that the earbuds can answer a phone call with a tap, but they cannot end the call with a tap. So, in order to hang up, I have to use my phone screen (or wait for the person I’m talking with to hang up).
• The earbuds verbalize information about the device, each time you put them in your ear. I can see how some people might prefer this, but I prefer just a simple one or two note “chime” to let me know the earbud is connected to the device. These earbuds state the following, each time I put them in: *chime*… pause… “Battery at __%”… pause… “connected”. This will happen, even if you’re listening to music or are actively talking on the phone & you swap earbuds. Again, not a huge problem, but a frequent nuisance.

THE PROS:
Now, despite these gripes, I will say that the sound quality of both phone calls and music are REALLY good (for the price of the earbud). Moreover, I have used AirPods, Beats Pro, and JBL earbuds… and I have had a few people tell me that the sound quality of my voice for them (when on the phone) is noticeably better. I did not ask these people before hand, they voiced it on their own accord. One person even said “did you get new headphones?! I can hear you so much better now!”. For these reasons, despite my many personal gripes, I am keeping the headphones. But buyer beware, they are definitely frustrating at times."
"I purchased these in November 2023 and have been using them regularly for the past few months. The sound quality is amazing, I absolutely adore the “personal sound” through the app it uses. It connects really easily, barely a hassle. I like the added features, like how it can connect to Spotify instantly and play from the earbuds, or how it can detect whether or not you’re listening to an audiobook/podcast and adjust volumes accordingly. I also like the noise cancelling, it has a slider where you can adjust how much or how little you’d want. Overall, when it comes to the sound, it knocks it out of the ballpark.

Though, one of my only gripes with it is the fit. It wasn’t built for movement. Even walking around with it indoors, it tends to pop out unless I continually push it back in. I’ve tried the multiple ear tips provided, but it doesn’t seem to help much. The other gripe I have with it is the controls, and how sensitive it is. Remember how I mentioned I have to continually push it back in? Well, 9/10 times I’ll accidentally pause the song, skip, or start pairing mode. The touch controls are nice, but I wish it wasn’t as sensitive, because the slightest poke sends it into a frenzy.

Overall, it’s amazing if you’re just using it at home, stationary. The sound and battery life is phenomenal. If you plan to use it on the go, walking to and from places, etc. I’d advise to go elsewhere."
"Awesome sound from these little ear buds. Great for working out or just chilling. I am able to hear what is going on around me so going out for a run I can still hear traffic or others around me. That feature can be turned off so if i want to immerse myself in the music or a movie, I can do that as well. I am real pleased with the quality of sound and the excellent bass these have. Highly recommend."
"Out of the box, I wasn’t a big fan of these. The sound was pretty tinny and pretty weak. I saw someone recommend the Movie mode in the EQ. That helped a little bit. But the real change was when I went into the custom EQ setting and played around with it. The sound is awesome now. I put it behind my AirPod Pros, but ahead of all the other earbuds I have.

I did only give it 4 stars because of the noise cancellation, or lack thereof. If you’re going to tout the feature in the name of the product, at least put some effort into it. I hardly notice a difference from when it’s on or off."
"Los compré por el descuento que al final fue lo único de atractivo. No sé si es mi oreja, la forma del auricular o qué pero con ninguna de las 3 almohadillas me siento cómodo a los pocos segundos de acomodarlos se mueven y el sonido se filtra dejando inservible el ANC. Pensé que la calidad de sonido iba a ser mejor, no se que tan mal estoy juzgando pero siento que suenan a auriculares chinos. Vi reseñas en Youtube y decían que al principio el sonido era malo pero con actualizarlos esto mejoraría bastante (Desde que abrí los míos me salió que están en la última version, en lo personal nunca los actualicé yo mismo) pero al menos resuelven. Hace par de años tuve unos Indy Evo y me encantaban esos auriculares hasta q se los comió mi perro, no puedo sentirme así con estos"
"Ok I've used these for a few months now. The sound is great, I'm more partial to bass and these delivered. The noise cancelling was really good no complaints there. The stay aware feature needs more work, the outside noise I could only hear if the volume was at the lowest setting. The Tile feature, is freaking awesome! Iost these bad boys a couple times and found them easily when connected with Tile. The battery life is also really good, I have only run out of juice once when I had a busy day.

For the most part, everything worked really good. But there is one thing that is annoying but I'm dealing with because everything works awesome. I have to re-map the buttons the way I want at least once a week. It only takes a few moment but it is super annoying."
"I really like these headphones but there were a few things I didn't like.

I love the touch controls but when working out and sweating the controls are triggered. Ends up pausing and skipping songs while I'm workout out. I turned off the touch controls but it's a pain always reaching for my phone.

Not loud enough when in the gym. Planet, LA and 24hr fitness all play pretty loud music and I can still hear it when I have the headphones all the way up. Played with all the settings and it just wasn't good enough for me.

For now I'll stick with my grind fuels"
I have had many ear buds over the years and these are the best I’ve had. The app you use with them offers great customization. I’m sure there are better but at a much higher price point. Definitely worth the purchase
"I am a big fan of the SC line of ear buds. Let's get that out of the way. I own a set of Grind and Push Active, currently, and the case for the Push stopped charging, which is why I am here.

I had really high hopes for these and was really let down. I purchased a set (XT) from Walmart and they sounded terrible. I returned them and saw these on sale and got them, thinking they might be different. The Walmart set was tagged with the 'XT' qualifier, so I didn't know if there were different components used in them.

There aren't.

1. I feel like I have average sized hands for a dude, so I don't know why I seem to fumble with getting the buds out and into the case. And when I say fumble, I'm talking about the kind of fumble that causes them to fall down a storm drain 10 feet away. I have had to hunt them down because they shot across the room when getting them out. I don't do that with my other sets. I feel like its my technique, but I dont know what the right one is...
2. Touch Sensitivity is off the charts. I cannot turn up the volume, turn on ANC or anything else without accidentally pausing what I am listening to, EVERY SINGLE TIME. If you want to take one out to talk to someone, don't hold it in your hand. Now my boss knows I listen to Hailee Steinfeld, and SkullCandy is to blame. 100%. Thanks... I stopped using this feature, I lost patience and went back to doing everything on my phone. This may be a ""give it time"" thing or maybe making pause/play three taps is the answer.
3. The sound. It's kinda bad... especially when you get up in volume. Even at about 75% I can hear distortion and they're no louder than my other sets at 75%. This is why I returned the XT to Walmart, because of this distortion. I do not have this issue with the Grind or Push Active, even at 100%.

I don't know what happened.

The positives:
1. The announcement is toned down and less obtrusive. So if someone calls and I want to put them in, I dont have to pause my convo for 45 seconds. I can hear over it enough now to understand what's being said.
2. The bass on them is really f'in nice, which is what I wanted when I bought these. I think this is the trade-off with distortion though, which is a major bummer. I will say that when these things get rockin with a nice bass track that doesn't distort, they can wiggle themselves right out of your ear. All you have to do is push them back in...

pause..."
"These sound great and fit well, but I often have to forget/delete them and re-find to connect."
"My wireless skull candy ear buds are perfect for me. I use them while working outside, and find the easy pause on them is awesome. If I need to pause my music I simple tap on the outer side of one of the ear buds and the music pauses. To start again just a simple tap. The case they come it great also. Its a mini storage case that charges my ear buds within the safety of the case. Love it"
Great sound and ease of use. The noise cancelling feature works really well.
bought these for my mom and she likes them but they don't want to turn off when you put them back in the lil box which made it so she couldn't hear anything on her phone.
"Bought these during Amazon's Black Friday sale with the express purpose of listening to music at work. Up until today (3/5/2024), when this review is being written, ownership has been fantastic. The Rail ANC earbuds performed effortlessly and are light-years ahead of my previous earbuds from Gravastar. However, one earbud, the left specifically, has ceased to emit any sound. Its touch and ANC features still operate, but there is zero sound emitted through the speaker. This is the first time an earbud or similar device has done this in my experience, and while I know nothing is perfect forever, but I am wondering how it happened. I have my volume set to its lowest setting and do not drop, abuse, or otherwise mistreat the device. When not in use, both earbuds are stored in the charging case. I should also add that I did attempt to pair the earbuds as if for the first time and the left earbud still refused to emit any sound. A disappointment to an otherwise fantastic product."
"These earbuds are really good sound wise and noise cancelling wise! The battery on them is also really good. However they do have a bunch of annoying issues. For example sometimes they will connect to your phone even thought they are in their case and should be off. Every once in a while they wont even connect and you will have to go to settings, forget device, then pair them to your phone again. And if you had custom control settings you will have to redo that in the app again. I recently had another issue where one of them was not charging and I basically had to wait for it to die and then it charged… like huhh. Overall the earbuds are good listening wise and battery wise I even like them better than the airpods but they just have so many tedious issues that kinda ruins it. Also the case just feels a little cheap/flimsy hahah."
Darn near perfect except for occasional cutting out. Noise cancelling is 🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾 as per usual with SkullCandy. Don’t know why anyone would spend more $$$ for other brands.
Good
"I love the sound and the ANC. The ringing in my ears has finally died down. I wish they would allow more app compatibility on user app though. My preference is Pandora and while it does play on headphones, it fights with Spotify, because that it the default player. I wish they would allow the user to choose the default player. The earbuds have excellent sound, but the controls are very sensitive and activate at the slightest touch, which is slightly annoying.
** Update - the right earbud became intermittent, then the audio cut out completely, the controls still worked, but no more audio. I have sent the earbuds back to the company for warranty and I am currently waiting either for a new set or my repaired earbuds. Will update when I found out which."
"I don’t usually write reviews, but this was worthy of it. The sound is way better than AirPod pros. A little louder than the AirPod pro. The ANC is good not as good as AirPods but good. The comfort level is way better than AirPod and the price is exceptional."
"I've enjoyed using them. I love them. I have a friend interested in getting a pair.
Performance is excellent, button are easy. Charging is fast. Very comfortable. Easy to pick up and go"
"I really like these earbuds. They fit comfortably, great sound quality, great microphone. The battery use life between recharging seems kind of short. From fully charged to 30% in about 3 hours. The case recharges them quite fast. However, they fall out, no matter which pieces are used. Maybe it's the shape of my ear canal. But with the effort required to keep pushing them back in and the placement of the ""buttons"" on the piece, I end up disconnecting calls on the regular. If don't keep pushing them back in, they will fall out and then I'm scrambling on the zoom call to find the errant earbud that is now under my desk. Next time, I'll get the ones that have the over the ear loop."
"Unfortunately the design on these don't stay in your ear. It will constantly fall out your ear everytime you move or make a facial expression it starts chipping away out your ear.

Not only that cause it falls out your ear alot you have to readjust it to push it back In and the annoying part about that is the ear buds are touch sensitive meaning they habe touch sensitive buttons. So just touching the dumb earbuds pauses the audio or goes into this annoying voice announcer about switching into some kind of Spotify mode or something.

It ends up being like you're dealing with a annoying misbehaved kid while you're trying to enjoy any peace time. It's just a hassle to use them.

Other than that it would be a solid wireless ear buds if it weren't for these issues.

I like that when you turn them on it tells you how much battery life it has.

It has light indicators on the charger to let you know how much battery is left.

You can add bass on the app with the app adding other customizations.

I will say I'd like it if the volume was a tad bit louder than it is but again other than that it would have been a good product without the mentioned issues."
"The battery life in these earbuds are great. I normally only need to use one at a time and I don’t need to worry about missing music because it needs both earbuds, it recognizes just one being used and the audio adjusts. It works awesome for making phone calls. Everyone can hear me from either ear bud. This was a great purchase."
"They do work well and connected easily, the ANC is not very great by any means kind of a let down, the sensitivity of the button on the headphones is to much I don’t like that at all, the earbuds them selves as well are a little rough on the ears, I have the same issue with the old apple AirPods, over all tho not to bad for the price"
"Great pair headphones, skullcandy never miss with their mids, bass no questions asked. Comfortable fit to the point I fall asleep with them in my ears, waking with no pain from pressure points. Great battery life, however the Noise canceling is waaaaaay beyond disappointing, turn it on and I noticed there's barely any difference. Other than that still a great pair headphones I would recommend."
I like this brand because it isn't apple or the tiny buds that fall out of your ears. These fit but I do wish it had the wings like the Indy that stay in the ear better. The sound quality is amazing but you do need an app to maximize the features. I am happy with it and the wireless charging is nice. The other downside is the batter indicator light is a single blinking light instead of the 4 lights on the Indy. I recommend these and make sure to get the anc because without it these aren't worth it. The anc is good and can cut down 95% of my vacuum cleaner noise.
Good sound and ease of use
"I bought these after using the ANC Sesh for over a year after seeing that the battery life was supposed to be better than the ANC Sesh by a few hours. That was definitely not the case. With the ANC Sesh I could listen to music almost all day without having to charge them. With these I'd be lucky to got 3 hours before having to charge them and the headphones case battery runs out so much quicker. Very disappointed as I listen to music all day, every day while working."
"Music comes alive with this earbud. It’s can blow away the other expensive earbuds.
Not fit comfortable in the ear but it’s ok because the price is too good."
Great product
The sound is awesome
Tiene buen sonido
"After using these for about a month, I'm impressed with the sound and bass quality. However, I noticed that after a few hours of use, my ears start to feel a bit uncomfortable. This might be just me, but it's something to consider."
"Fir the price it's great, just too bad you have to have the app open for the equalizer to be adjusted, then they are amazing"
No cons all pros
"Better sound than her old ones. Flimsy material, but didn't haven't broke like her old ones. Software is unnecessary."
"I really do like them. Although they require a whole different Skullcandy app than the Indy evos do. And the battery life isn’t the best. I’ve used the ear bud for little over an hour, when I put it in, it was at 90% and now it’s saying battery low. I liked my almost two year old Indy evos more. Maybe with more use I’ll like these better but the actual ear bud life isn’t the best.

Now the right earbud doesn’t work at all. Won’t connect or say battery life. Really disappointed with these"
"The sound quality and fit on these are great. I wish the ""stay aware"" audio mode actually passed more ambient sound, but overall they're great.

Update: still loving these, but have noticed the touch controls stop working when I'm in direct sunlight. They get hot and stop responding to touch. They still work, but I do have to use my phone to pause the music."
You have to pay return through Skullcandy. One of the ear buds didn't work and they wouldn't exchange through Amazon. We had to pay to ship then back to Skullcandy but they did offer a generous exchange budget to buy new ones through their website.
These earbuds are really well constructed. The sound is excellent and I highly recommend these.
"The Skullcandy RAIL's offer a mix of impressive features but still has a few limitations. The Bluetooth connectivity is exceptional, ensuring a seamless pairing process, stable connection, and quick reconnection. The device excels in battery performance, boasting extended life and rapid charging capabilities. However, it falls short for gaming enthusiasts due to noticeable latency issues, impacting the overall gaming experience. Additionally, it's worth noting that the Skullcandy RAIL's do not have in-ear detection. Despite these limitations, the Skullcandy RAIL remains a strong contender for those prioritizing top-notch audio in their daily activities. What makes it even more appealing is that it offers these features at a great value for the money."
"This is a mixed review for me honestly . I like skullcandy for the audio quality and loudness, but when i make calls only some of who i call hear me well even with the ANC active."
Cancelación mala. Mejor compra el no ANC.
"I've been using the Skullcandy Indy Anc's but since I lost them I've switched over to the Rail Anc and it was worth it. The case, for starters, is more beautiful and distincable than I thought it would be with the glossiness at the top and and blue led light on this inside. The sound quality was good but I had higher expectations for the $100 I was spending. My only complaints would be the fact that they are a little too slippery in my ears so they're sometimes on the verge of falling out and the connectivity issues that I experienced with the Indy Anc. Overall an amazing set of earbuds to grab if you're looking for something reliable."
"Surprisingly good noise cancelling even when volume is very low. Neighbors have horrendous large barking dogs they do not control, these cancel that noise out, without having to blow my ear drums out with volume so loud. The bass is really strong too. I also like the app that has various settings for headphones, I am a bass head so I appreciate the pre-set equalizer that enhances bass. The only con is battery life is shorter than some other brands, but I'll take that for the much better noise cancelling in this price range. Great option for this price range.

I tried Anker noise cancelling ear buds, but they really could not compete with these as I had to have volume up almost max for same noise cancelling effect. At that point its merely just the louder noise blocking another less loud noise versus noice cancelling."
"Great bass, awesome sound, long battery life and the ANC is actually pretty good. For the price, you can’t go wrong."
"Wow, Easy to use, good looking, less expensive than I-crap, & other $200 buds etc. .... Give them a try, you'll be pleasantly SURPRISED !!!"
Great earbuds but the active noise cancellation is a joke
"Amazing value for the price! I’ve been using it daily, and it hasn’t disappointed me yet.
Very satisfied!!"
First pair had to send back cuz one wouldn't charge. Second set one only charges part way. Cool that they sync to dual devices. And voice control is nice. Sound is alright. But not worth full price.
"I've been a Skullcandy user for almost 20 years. I recently purchased and love them, the app is simple, syncing is easy. Sound is great, talking on call is good, voice command is awesome and I love the 2 ways your able to charge the earbuds. Definitely great value and Quality for what you pay for. I also love the way the look. The battery life is amazing. I've used them at work, the gym and pretty much all the time. My only critique is making them fully waterproof but are at least water and sweat resistant."
"Most headphones and earbuds lack any deep bass and can sound tinney at best. I have a pair of Skullcandy headphones that have exceptional bass with great highs and midranges. So, I thought, lets try the earbuds. I was blown away by the strong deep bass and again, exceptional sound quality. The app gives you the ability to further enhance your sound quality. So, if you are looking for quality sound with that strong deep vibrating bass, these earbuds work perfectly."
"If you want a lesser expensive earbuds, these are comfortable, high quality, sound amazing and I honestly would buy these over the other high priced brands"
"It’s alright, I bought it when it was on sale and I’ve had it for almost a month, and within the last week my left ear piece kept not working and somehow even when I cough the audio just disappears in my left ear piece which makes absolutely no sense to me. Makes sense why it was on sale, I honestly would not buy this headphones again if I had to choose."
"had them for about 3 months, lost them so bought another pair, very comfortable, great sound quality, great bass, amazing customization. only thing bad about them is sometimes they have trouble connecting but other than that amazing"
"Absolutely loved my purchase! The sound is so clean and crisp, unlike anything I've ever used in the past."
"First the pros: great sound with control in the iq app. Ease of changing tap response such as instead of one tap to increase volume you can change it to two taps. Charge is exactly as stated lasts a long time.
Cons: unfortunately the cons outway the pros. DOES NOT STAY IN EAR WHEN YOU MOVE. If you want to use these in a cubical or laying down their fine. Start to move around and they start to fall out. Can't change the tips much to anything bigger which came with it or it doesn't sit in the charger. I've tried buying different tips but nothing works. If they won't stay in their useless. Everything I try to adjust them back in my ear it wants to open Spotify (which I don't use) and is annoying.
I was so hopeful about these but now I regret buying them. If you looking for long last battery life, great sounds and control as long as they stay in your ear these are NOT what you want. Look elsewhere. So sad."
So far they sound great. Nice and clear sound. Decent bass. App has an adjustable eq so you can fine tune. Charges fairly quickly. Had multiple different brands and never had an issue with skullcandy. Hoping they deal well with every day wear and tear.
These are worth the price. Whether using as earphone or with noise cancelling. Work amazing.
I’ve used Apple AirPods for yearssss now and I and super impressed with the skull candy Rail ANC. I probably won’t ever go back to Apple ones and the app is super easy to use and I love how easy you can customize these to your personal liking I give it a 10/10!
"The sound is awesome, the battery life is awesome, the ANC works really well. But these are so uncomfortable with a conch piercing I'm going to have to have to return these. I can't wear them for more than 20 minutes at a time in my right ear. The touch controls are also super sensitive so I adjust them and it pauses."
Alta calidad... Original... Llego en buen estado funciona correptamente... Recomendado 100%
I got these for my son and he really likes them. I also tried them and thought the sound quality was pretty good and the anc pretty good. They're not spectacular and I was kinda hoping for more as my other son has some Skullcandy headphones and the bass on them is incredible.
Well tell you the truth it says it has options in my knowledge this sounds like skullcandy rail was exciting
"This has been the best Bluetooth that I've found that is clear, ppl can hear you without background noice"
"So I have noise canceling rail, buds, and non-noise canceling rail buds. They’re both really good the non-noise canceling ones. I got on a huge discount on their website. So I grabbed them. You’ll rarely find the noise canceling ones on sale so just beware of that because I thought I was ordering noise canceling and I was not.

These are noise canceling your ears really really good. I move around a lot. I talk a lot and earbuds. Just do not stay in my ears. I have a weird shaped ear I guess. They don’t stay in my ears no matter what and these do and they work really good!

Keeps the charge really really good. I’ve charged mine like twice since I’ve got them and I’ve had them for well over a month."
Decent headphones but no matter which ear piece you put in they would just slide out. They’re good if you’re just sitting around but nothing active at all.
One of the ears is out of power 20% of the times I go to use these. Probably connection issues in the case. Not a fun problem.
"Pretty disappointed in these, as they are literally a downgrade in almost all metrics from the Indy ANCs I have had previously. Sound quality seems fine, but that's about it. MANY connection issues including; The earbuds not pairing correctly sometimes, The earbuds will not disconnect or shut off when put in the pod, if the pod is not charged. The touch controls seem to require a random amount of touch/force to activate each time(sometimes a brush of hair will trigger it, sometimes a full pressed finger won't). The list goes on.
Most of this could be excused, or at least justified by the relatively inexpensive price, except I have owned two different pairs of the previous model the Indy ANC and neither of them had these problems.

TLDR: Worse product than the previous iteration for the same money. Womp womp."
I love them largest drivers in the earbud market
"I have the first Rail earphones, and I purchased these to check them out. Soundwise, these are solid, and I like how they fit. If you can swap the ear tips for foam, you will get a much better sound and fit.

The ANC and transparency are sub-par. I have similar-priced Jlab earphones with ANC and transparency that do a better job. I also have the Beats+ earphones, which are top-level on ANC and transparency.

Although I like how they sound and fit, their main advertised feature, active noise cancellation, is not their most robust feature. Future firmware upgrades could make them better. These are all right, but buyer beware - preferably buy if on sale."
"Never knew I had sensitive ears, but had a reaction to these. Switched out the soft in your ear part 3 times with the same result. They work good"
Just awesome
Decent play time. They could be louder sensitive to the touch they disconnected or stop playing when you adjust them in your ears. Don't love them don't hate them.
"I was pretty taken off guard by all the features these had compared to cheaper older earbuds I've had, the features and everything are great, good sound quality. The only complaint I have is that the noise cancelation, ambient sound setting, and regular earbuds sound setting all sound exactly the same for some reason which was honestly a bit of a bummer because I got these earbuds for that feature specifically but whatever they're nice. They also look pretty cool."
"I've used airpods pros 2 for a while and decided to try these out, these sound very close to those but with more bass and a really fun app. These are some of the best headphones I've had and will definitely be my pick from now on"
"Love these headphones! I didn't want to break the bank, but also wasn't trying to find something cheap. These are perfect midrange headphones that have a great bit of customizable sound settings in the app!"
"I wanted to try this pair of earbuds because I owned the skullcandy crushers. Because I like BASS! The earbud has amazing bass and good sound quality. The ANC is not the best but does the job well enough. The worst part for me though, it gave me a scab in my inner ear. Proving that the product quality isn't made of the best materials as only certain earbuds do this to me. For example, the Beats studio pro earbuds also did this to me. Not sure why, something to do with the plastic pieces being exposed instead of being covered by a silicone covering of some sort. The next bad thing is that these eabuds will pick up alot of background noises when in a call. But for the price, Skullcandy made a clever little product that stands out with its design and brings that BASS low ends to life!! That's why people usually buy Skullcandy, in my personal perspective, to be able to hear the bass. Lol."
They sound great and fit great but sometimes disconnects randomly. They don’t really do much as far as noise canceling but for the price they are alright. Giving 4 stars out of 5 just because Active Noise Canceling is part of the name and it doesn’t do it very well.
"I never heard of JLab before I went researching for earbuds to use for work. I did get these on sale for $135 so that really enticed me to try these out. I mainly use them for work for Teams calls on my PC (dongle) and bluetooth with my phone. Music around the house and on walks is a bonus. Initial thoughts is ""WOW"" as the carrying/charging case quality feels great as it is metal and has a good heft. The materials used for the buds and dongle are also top-notch and feel high-end. There are plenty of earbud tips to personalize and I didn't have any fitment issues with the medium tips. The buds stay in the ear securely and surprisingly comfortably considering their weight. They are noticeably more comfortable than the JBL Quantum TWS and the Jabra Evolve2 Buds that I was comparing them against. They are even more comfortable than the similarly-sized but lighter Galaxy buds.

The phone app doesn't have a ton of customization or testing that you find in other brands, but it works fine. Would be nice to see JLab work on it more to add more settings and features.

Audio quality over bluetooth and the dongle is excellent. I'm not an audiophile, but they sound clear and crisp. Bass and treble are strong and the equalizers (especially the preset ones) are great.

Microphone quality is decent and as expected from a earbud product. Obviously, it works better in a quiet environment. Turning off MS Teams noise suppression helps.

ANC works, but nothing mind blowing. Should work fine on an airplane, but I wouldn't put it up against Bose or other higher end offerings. I like the Hear Through feature and that seems to work very well even with directional noises.

There are a few things I didn't like about them... I wasn't able to simultaneously connect to the dongle on my PC and a phone over bluetooth. Using the dongle seems to make the connection exclusive and I have to unplug the dongle to connect to my phone. Couldn't confirm if that's the way it's supposed to work or just me. Also, when the buds are removed from the case a voice says ""JLAB ON"" loudly which is annoying. A nice tone or jingle would've been preferred. Some users also complained about the difficulty in taking the buds out of the case, but I have skinny fingers so that was a non-issue. The magnets are strong which keeps them from falling out.

Although I'm having not a perfect experience using these with my PC and phone (simultaneously) I'm still keeping them as their comfort, audio quality, and battery life will definitely serve me well outside of work."
"I caught these on sale for $129.00. I’ve seen other reviewers say they got a sale price of $99.00. They list at $199.00. My personal opinion is, these are not $199 ear buds.

They are well made for sure and sound great! The bass response to treble response is just right and neither end is overly emphasized. The EQ of these sits just right for me. Don’t worry bass heads there is plenty of bass if you want it, it just doesn’t overwhelm the rest of the listening spectrum.

The Bluetooth connectivity is on par with ear buds in this price range for sure. I have no problem leaving my phone in my living room and doing work in other parts of the house. It’s a ingle level home, so I can’t speak for basement dwellers.

I have sensitive ears, as far as having anything stuck in them, I found them to be very comfortable once I found the right ear piece. I went through all of the included ear plugs (for lack of a better term). Ultimately I ended up settling on the large foam plug.

Comfort and fit while mowing my lawn, I found that even the large rubber plug still allowed the ear bud to twist out of place when sweating. I did not find any difference in sound between either type of plug as some reviewers have mistakenly indicated. It’s just a matter of which feels more comfortable to you.

I love that I can charge these on a charging pad or via USB-C. I usually charge via a pad. I can’t speak on how long they last off the charger.

Bottom line the sound stage is exactly what I like and is balance and crystal clear. They fit my picky ear and don’t hurt. My ears have a tendency to try and hold things in place which means they cramp over time, my ears are relaxed when I’m wearing these versus other ear buds I’ve owned.

Sorry that was a longer “Bottom Line” than I intended. So, just get them if you value audio quality over hyper EQ’d junk buds.

PS I think the price point should be around $129, but go on sale for $99.00. These aren’t B O S E."
"I don't work in a peaceful environment with timid people, who are respectful of each other and know how to shut up. No.
I work in a warehouse. Not a good warehouse. A small warehouse. With 30 people in a single room. People who literally SCREAM along with the music playing over the speakers. People who think being the most annoying person possible is funny. What's worse. It's 10 hour shifts.
I've had enough. I decided, time for noise canceling headphones!! This review is for someone in the same position as me. That NEEDS, DESPERATELY, some way to shut down the noise around them.

After much debate, I decided between two choices. The Jlab Epic Lab True Edition (200 USD) and the new Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra headphones. (250 USD)
I went with these two because
1) I was very interested how jlabs new signature headphones would compare to the 20$ version they offer. I wondered how much better it could be for 200$, also I was interested in the Knowles corporation equalizer preset. Big audio company.
2) Bose is the leader of ANC headphones. I've never had a pair so I had to see what the fuss was about.
I got both of these on Amazon knowing I can return the worst pair within 30 days.

After using these, I want to apologize to my past self for not doing this sooner. I have broken them in over the past week at work, and it's the only time I have been there I haven't wanted to walk out within hours or gotten crazy depressed. I realized. I actually like my job.

Let's start with jlab
I'm going to get this out of the way. If you relate to my situation at all. These are not the headphones for you.
IF you have a good life. A good job. One without people literally screaming in your ear 10 hours. Please get these.
The audio quality on these are amazing. I was shocked. I honestly teared up when putting my favorite song on for first time. I heard parts of that song I have NEVER heard. You will experience this. The Knowles setting is life changing. These are a daily driver for sure. I am impressed. Comfortable and very water resistant.
The active noise canceling is actually pretty good. I could barely hear my husband with music on. But my situation....multiple...people...yelling, in union, to Taylor swift.
The jlabs can not handle it lol. It does get muffled...a bit. Which honestly, is loads better than just white knuckling it. But if you are looking for strictly ANC, don't get these at 200$. Are they worth 200$ on sound quality alone. Gods yes. Are they worth that...to ME. Ehh..

Bose.
Honestly I was not expecting to like these as much. I heard a lot of things about loss of connectivity plus not being water resistant. In my warehouse. I do get water on my hands sometimes so I did not have high hopes. But let me tell you.
The second I put these on at work, before the music played it did the ANC switch and I was the happiest I have been in months. It instantly took out the warehouse music, the machines, the fans, the background noises and 80% of the talking. I felt like I could breathe for once. The overstimulation gone like *snaps*.
Then the music started playing. I was watching my coworkers mouths and I broke out in a huge grin that lasted minutes. I could see them talk, but hear them talk I could not. This is the first week in months where I didn't get depressed after about 30 minutes of that.
So the ANC is legendary. The sound...is not. I keep looking at my jlabs like... ???
How do they sound so much better?!
I think the bose default settings out of box is just too treble heavy. I used the app to set mine +9, +4, -2.
That is the closest I can get it to sound like jlabs but they still don't. Why?! I don't know why. They still do sound good. Like a 8/10. That plus not hearing my coworkers discuss if lobsters have souls, makes this purchase on sale at $250 a steal for me.

I'm going to be returning the Jlabs and looking for a future sale. I would like to have them in my collection for when I just need some good headbanging. Both headphones are great, but get the one you need for the life you live. Take care!"
"Let me start my saying I am no stranger when it comes to high-end, top tier TWS. If it sounds good and it performs well, I'm interested. I don't discriminate by brand, nor am I loyal to any one brand...all I care about is if it performs well. I own a wide range, from the Moondrop Space Travel, all the way to the Beoplay EX. In between, I've got the Technics az60, Sony XM4, Sennheiser MTW3, Status Between 3ANC, MW07 and the Bose QC2. I'd name drop more, but I'm not trying to brag. All I'm saying is I have heard enough of what's out there to make an informed decision and form a proper opinion on JLab's most premium offering. Long story short, these are fantastic at $200, and you should really consider them over anything else at this price range. Here are the main reasons:

Sound quality: I'm not a pretentious audiophile, so you won't catch me talking like I can taste or touch sound. All those descriptors like how the mids are ""brittle"" or ""crunchy"" are absolutely moronic, and they don't help anyone who's actually looking to use common sense to make a decision. I won't talk about how the lows, mids and hi's are, and all that frequency talk is word salad. At the end of the day, here's what you need to know....there's this thing called ""detail"". It's what helps you hear each instrument individually and clearly. If you don't have it, you're listening to a wall of sound where things blend into each other. These have great detail. Listen to ""Thriller"" and you'll hear every finger-snap and every twang of a guitar riff I bet you didn't even know was there.

Additionally, it's got a good sound stage. That's how far apart the instruments sound. You can again listen to ""Thriller"" and hear different instruments play in different parts of your left and right ear. Some parts play behind you and some play off to the left. Sufficed to say, it really helps with the immersion.

Last thing about sound, the app has an EQ. It's pretty good. I recommend the Knowles preset =)

Features: the dongle it comes with is the truth. It lets you plug into any other phone, tablet or computer you may have that has a usb-c port, and listen from there without pairing. Additionally, it's got some great codecs and Bluetooth version, all of which guarantee you get a great connection, which means better ability to stream a higher quality. It's got spatial audio, so you can listen to 360 audio on Tidal, and LDAC for all the cool Sony stuff.

ANC/Transparency: it's not God tier, like the Bose or Sony, but it's VERY good. Combine the ANC with the good volumes this can put out, and you're in your own world when you want to be.

Build Quality: metal case. Feels cool to the touch, and strong and sturdy to boot. It's small enough to throw into a front pocket and not make you look like awkward.

There are way too many little details I'm not including, but there are very few downsides I can think of when it comes to these. Again, I've heard some of the best, and these are right up there. Give JLabs a try, you will not regret it."
"Edit: One of the earbuds now pops shortly after putting them on and the sound changes, not sure what the issue is. Notifies Jlab support and waiting for a reply.

They sound great, function well, no issues so far. I noticed some cloudiness on the right ear in there transparent part but it’s clear on the other side, not sure if this is intentional. These have all the functionality I was looking for."
"I bought these earbuds for a very specific purpose - I wanted low-latency earbuds with a dongle for direct connection - I did not want to deal with Bluetooth any more than I had to. Anything else was a bonus.

These earbuds do what I expect and much more so - the audio quality is great - not audiophile level for sure, but if you need 100% accurate reproduction then why are you looking at wireless earbuds? The noise canceling is good enough - it works sufficiently to drown out background noise, but is nowhere near as refined as offerings from competitors. The app is surprisingly functional; I wish there was a bit more customization for the tap gestures, but what is on offer is pretty good. Lastly, the feel of the buds, from the case, dongle, and earbuds themselves is nice; the metal case gives confidence in its sturdiness, and the dedicated dongle slot is a nice addition.

The biggest thing I need to comment on is the battery life - these last a loooong time. Perhaps not as long as the advertising suggests, but at least sufficient to get through a workday with a brief, earbud-free break in the middle of the day.

Overall, you have to weigh these against their cost - many like myself get these on sale, so for ~$100 it is very difficult to find too much fault. The other earbuds I was considering with these features were easily double the cost, if not close to triple. Given that value preposition, these earbuds find a very healthy balance between cost, features, and quality. Overall I am happy with my purchase!"
"Pros:
Beautiful sound!
Long battery life.
Easy pairing.
Inductive/no wire charging.
Cool lil control panel app thing.
Excellent audio cancellation for steady noise environment (datacenter/industrial use)

Cons:
Absolutely terrible shape, difficult to grip to remove from case, doesn't stay centered on ears. Terrible for motorcycle usage.
Falls out of ears, is entirely dependent on ear plug, no support from anything not directly in ear channel. Terrible for motorcycle usage.
Audio cancellation useless against wind/random audio. Terrible for motorcycle usage.

I bought these as a replacement for a significantly more fancy brand and they do great so long as I'm not doing anything strenuous. These are insufficiently awesome for motorcycle or 'getting under the machine' industrial use. Great, fabulous for 'walking around while either taking a call or listening to music in an industrial setting'.

My use case is ""long-hours high fidelity audio on a motorcycle"" so these really disappoint for that."
"I previously had the original OnePlus Buds Pro for over 2 years and had to find a replacement as the battery in one of the earbuds was starting to only last about 20 to 30 minutes on a charge. These were $99 on Prime day and the reviews looked promising so I gave them a shot. I thought the Buds Pro sounded good but the sound on these is amazing. Everything sounds clear and it doesn't take much volume to be able to hear everything well. Aware mode does a good job of passing sound through, I like that it detects when something is extra loud and cuts it off. Noise cancelling does great with things like fan noise and is decent with voices but doesn't completely shut them out. The battery life so far is really good, I've used them for 3 or 4 hours straight a few times and still had quite a bit of charge left when I put them back in the case. Multipoint works well to connect to my iPhone and PC at the same time. The USB-C dongle is extremely handy to go from one computer to another quickly and also makes a dedicated and slightly higher quality connection to the device it's plugged into so it works well for things like Teams and Zoom calls on a PC where the sound quality is maximized and I don't have to worry about an incoming phone call trying to take over a Bluetooth connection. The only change I'd suggest would be an option to switch the voice notification for everything like ""Bluetooth Connected"", ""Noise Cancelling On"" to simple tones, mostly because short tones would be less intrusive to the listening experience. Otherwise, epic job, JLab."
"Got it at a bang up price, 100 bucks. And let me say they are definitely worth more than the 100. Originally priced at 200. I was formerly using the Soundcoure Anker Liberty 4 NC and though I love those so much I've bought them 4 different times?

These have beat them in almost every way. The ear fit was an adjustment. But the transparency mode is cleaner, the sound is more clean and boom for your, the noise cancellation is supreme. And the biggest issue which I can't decide if I like or not is it tells me what mode I'm in when toggling noise cancellation but it doesn't stop what you're playing so it over talks it

That and I wish I didn't have to toggle between all 3. I would like the choice to choose how many I togglel between but absolutely these are an 8/10 no doubt"
"I bought these headphones specifically because of the LC3 codec. I like having headphones that I can game with as well as take on the go and use with bluetooth. I didn't want to have to remember to take a dongle with me every time I wanted to game at a friends house so It would have been really nice if I could leave the dongle in the case for when I want to use devices that don't have bluetooth or new enough bluetooth (like my PC at work) and then connect my phone and PC to the earbuds without the dongle and have low latency audio.

Unfortunately as far as I can tell LC3 only works over LE not classic bluetooth on these earbuds and they don't seem to support pairing in LE mode. This means the only way to use the LC3 codec is to use the dongle. And yes before you ask I do have a pixel 8 and a linux PC which both support LE audio and LC3.

To be perfectly honest I probably would have still bought these even if I was told about this because lc3 support is very hard to come by anyway. I just don't consider dongle only as supporting a Bluetooth codec without mentioning that caveat. I thought the dongle was a bonus for the sake of compatibility not required.

JLab if your reading this you can turn my review into a 5 star by adding support for LC3 without the dongle. Which is what I believed they could do when I bought them."
"picked these up on a whim after seeing some solid reviews and i can attest that the sound quality matches the name of the buds, it truly is epic, approaches the sound quality of some of my over the ear headphones. the earbuds generally work well in most regards with the caveat of the voice announcement for each time a mode is changed being annoying. the battery life is excellent and, while not a feature, the left bud can be worn in the right ear (and vice versa) if you want to listen with a single bud and have extended use.

the only other thing that could be a little better is transparency. transparency is great for hearing what is around you but speaking with the buds in is a bit more ""water in the ear"" sounding than competitors. i don't expect them to be on the level of AirPods Pro but they could be a bit better.

there is, for me, a fatal flaw. i wear my earbuds throughout the day while i work. For better or for worse i'm a Mac user and have my MacBook setup so that i can make a receive calls on it via coherence from my iPhone. This is a flawless solution with every other set of headphone i own but it basically doesn't work with these JLAB Epic Lab buds. In a very rare instance i can accept a call and the buds work as they should but greater than 90% of the time there is no function from the bud - no sound or mic function. That is an absolute deal breaker.

To compound this, when going into sound settings in the MacBook it correctly displays that the computer is using the buds for input and output (speaker and mic) but it will never register any input sound from the mic no matter what changes i make in that setting.

I'm assuming this could probably be resolved with a firmware update but the buds are fully updated so no idea when that might occur.

For most casual users, especially those using them solely with an iPhone or android device, these are an excellent choice. They work perfectly with my phone but not with my intended use case. As it stands I am going to have to return them.

Overall i'm scoring these as 3 stars mostly because of my use case. they would easily be 4 stars+ absent that problem. the sound quality is very good."
"These sound great and stay in my ears better than most. I used cheap pairs for years and have been blown away at the quality of these earbuds. Battery life lasts me most of the day but with the case they can be used all day. Good range on the Bluetooth.

Updated: I've owned these for 3.5 months and they are no longer working. To be fair I drain the battery 6 days a week, 2x a day my days. They sound quality is still good but they turn off randomly now, they slip out of my ears during workouts often but that's normal for me. Wish they would've lasted longer."
"I'm a little bit of an audiophile so I was looking for multi-driver wireless earbuds that did more than just play music; these fit the bill. They sound almost as good my last pair of triple driver wired earbuds, which I can no longer use as my new phone does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack. I listen to a wide variety of music ranging from hair bands to classic rock to yacht rock to jazz. Using the included ""Knowles"" equalization, I found the bass and treble to be well balanced without over powering the vocals. Also, they do support LDAC Codecs and actually allowed my phone to switch to LDAC. I tried two other brands of earbuds and had to return them because, although they claimed LDAC compatibility, they failed to allow it to activate on my phone (and yes, I put my phone in developer mode but still could not switch to LDAC). These JLABS hooked up easily the first time and immediately allowed LDAC to be selected along with the 96,000 sample rate. The storage case for the buds supports wireless charging. It is aluminum and slightly heavy, which adds a quality feel. The bluetooth range is about 40 feet with no obstructions. The only ding I have at this point is battery life; I'm only getting about 4 hours while running at near max volume. Overall, a quality product that I recommend for those who appreciate good sounds."
"Overall great earbuds for the price point. I was looking at the Technics, Sony, and Sennheiser at the $199+ price point and these guys popped up in my searches. After reviewing the supported Bluetooth audio codecs I found that the JLabs supported more hi-res audio codecs like LDAC and aptX-HD and new LC3. I thought I was going to have a need for the USB-C dongle, but now using the headset I found that most of my devices have bluetooth baked in nowadays. Another thing that swayed my decision to these is the bluetooth multi-point support, which allows you to have two devices connected simultaneously like your PC and phone, and have it switch seamlessly between audio sources. This feature works okay, not perfect, but it does work. It will lag at times when switching back to my windows 10 PC, it's not a deal breaker, but I thought it would work better/faster. Lastly, all the provided ear tips didn't fit my ear, which is critical for proper seal in ear to get the proper audio quality. I even called there support to see if they had larger, and they didn't unfortunately. I luckily had some replacement Comply ear tips from my older earbuds, and those fit the Jlabs, and most importantly they still fit in the charging case without issue. I decided to keep them, but if I didn't have those Comply ear tips I would have returned them day 1. Also the Comply foam tips I used were medium so it's not like I have super sized ears lol. The ANC is actually something I didn't know I wanted, it works good for my office setting and drowns out all the background chatter."
Would've given five stars but ....when you're on a call it's perfect in my opinion however seven out of ten times after you're finish with the call you have to restart the phone to get the phone or any other bluetooth device that is connected to work again even after disconnect it the phone or other device still won't work until the phone is restarted I reach out to customer help but the problem haven't slove ....I'm using a galaxy S21+ and never had this problem with any other jlab earbuds
"Extremely disappointed. The right earbud stopped working after two mouths (four uses). I didn’t use these for awhile after purchasing and can no longer return them. Major waste of money for such poor performance.

***Update***
I was able to submit a warranty claim through JLab. They immediately handled it and I was sent a replacement pair. Very good, easy and fast warranty process."
"I knew of Jlab before but hadn't owned any of their earbuds. After coming across a few positive reviews, I decided to give these a shot and I'm impressed. LDAC is stable, the sound quality of the dual drivers coupled with the Knowles Balanced EQ is great, and the mic is almost too loud for calls, a welcome change from other earbuds being muffled or muted. The ANC isn't the best, but with a good seal it does make a difference. As of now, Bluetooth LE Audio isn't enabled (the dongle uses Opus) but I'm happy with LDAC. The metal case with a grippy bottom is a great design choice I haven't seen before.

Aside from the ANC, my only gripes are minor:
The outer plastic of the buds is just slippery enough to make them difficult to remove from the case at times, they're a little larger than previous pairs (understandably), there's no dark mode in the app, and there's no multipoint/connection history list."
"I have for many years used either Bose or Sony wireless earbuds, so giving these jlabs a go was a major leap of faith. Definitely glad I did as they have blown my expectations out of the water! The tuning mechanism in the jlab app is really nice and I tend to leave on the Knowles setting as it truly is a major cool sound feature to these earbuds.

Noise cancellation is pretty good in my opinion, maybe not as nice as the Bose & Sony offerings...but definitely blocks most surrounding noise out.

Battery life is pretty exceptional even with noise cancelling active all the time. The case offers numerous recharges before a plugged in charge needs to happen. Reliable Bluetooth connection 99% of the time and has a good range when I'm not right by my phone.

All in all, these are well worth the price tag as they cost well below the high end brand counterparts. Happy I went this route!"
"I've never heard of Jlabs but I personally own allot of different wireless earbuds mostly of my ineptitude of memory for where I last put them but besides that I wanted to give this a shot coming from samsungs pro 2. So to begin of what it lacks i don't know if it's me but on the jlab app you can alter to whatever u want the earbuds to do regarding pause, resume, etc but when I pause it using the touch sensor I can't resume the music or video using the touch control again so i have to turn on my phone just to fix that, it doesn't bother me allot but to those it might, consider that a warning. Now it's audio quality I wasn't expecting game changing it's alright compared to others at that price. BUT this is my greatest LOVE about these earbuds I bought these December 9th it is now of my typing this up December 23rd I have not charged the case since I first got it, and I use it daily no matter how far I drain the earbuds the case never seems to die which I have been most impressed with right now it has 50% currently. I never write reviews even for the other earbuds I've gotten in the past so to me expect good sound quality, ( just in case it's me inadequate touch controls ) and amazing battery quality."
"While the anc isn't great it doesn't need to be. The sound these can deliver is enough to drown out the world while maintaining nice detail. The dongle option is a very nice extra as well that set these above the competition as they do sound better when connected via dongle. They're a very nice fit for larger ears like mine, and remain stable."
"I have been looking for new earbuds for awhile now. I read many reviews and have done alot of research. The first pair I bought was the Jabra Elite10s. I was whole heartedly disappointed with them. They sounded like crap to me and the ANC was nothing special. They did not live up to the hype so returned them and searched more. I really thought about getting an expensive pair from the top manufacturers but couldn't pull the trigger after having my Jabra experience. I found these on a whim and was drawn to the dual drivers and reasonable price.

The sound on these Jlabs is really very impressive. They have great separation and importantly decent bass although they are not overly bassy. You can use EQ to adjust to liking. Hands down better than the more expensive Jabras.

They fit very well for my ears and feel secure. They are also light so they dont tend to pull themselves out of the ear. No complaints on fit and wearability.

ANC works better than the Jabras but is not life changing. ANC was not as important to me as sound quality so I have no gripes.

Overall these earbuds feel very high quality and sound great. For the price I'm not sure any of the more expensive buds would be worth it. Iv only had them for a short time so will need to see how they hold up but so far they are real winners. If your like me and value Sound quality these Jlabs should be high on your list."
"Overall it is a good pair of earbuds in terms of audio quality and function with the usb c transmitter. The disappointing part was that the earbuds were brought in March 2024 and in the month of August 2024 the earbuds started to fail in producing audio. The warranty was easy to deal with thankfully, but I question the quality and how long these earbuds are meant to last. Hopefully the replacement last a lot longer than 5 months."
"Sound quality is ok, noise canceling is spotty at best battery life is ok lasting 5hrs of play time. Don't recommend this for a work place setting but may be ok at a gym or out on a run."
"So honestly i was interested to try out for myself to see if Jlab epic lab edition is good or no and when i finally got my hand on these earbuds i was so happy when it arrive like promising but however i did experience with defective on one side of earbuds while on the other one is working like that disappoint me cause i rather hear them both instead of one and i'm annoyed even app is like meh they say on left earbuds is low battery while right earbud is 100 and i try to see if sound is that promising and sound is good that all i gonna say bout that sound. I just didn't even get a chance to test out the other feature due to trying to get left side fix but without being said since i'm annoyed that it had one earbuds working while other earbuds is not so im returning the JLAB Epic Lab Edition cause i honestly don't know if i could recommend since i havent try all of the feature and also the fit is okay even tho i felt like it gonna fall out but it alright so that what made me wanted to return the product and that is my honest word.

rating:
Sound: 7/10
Fit: 5/10
Touch: 5/10
App: 4/10
Feature: ? (Haven't try out due to one side not working like it won't let me unless if one side is charge so yep)

That is my honest review and that it."
"Active noise control was ok at best, it didn't drown out enough background noise to immerse me into games like my headphones do and I could hear static, drove me nuts.

Now musically these sounded good, the vocals were clear, I could clearly hear the other instruments but bass was a bit light even after trying to boost it.

Gaming wise it highlights the vocals a bit too much while toning down the other sound effects. Monster roars were soft when they should be intimidating/loud. Latency was excellent and I couldn't perceive a delay.

Overall I'd recommend these to someone who wanted one set of earbuds that could do everything decently but it just can't replace headphones for immersion."
"Jlab isn't a brand I would have considered for myself before now. I bought a pair of the kids bluetooth headphones for my goddaughter a few years ago, and I just ordered her a pair of the Jlab Air earbuds, but for myself I tend to stick to Sony and Bose.

These are kind of blowing my mind though. The build quality of the earbuds and the case is very good. The metal case feels high end. The USB-C dongle is handy and something nobody else includes. The battery life is out of this world. About 8 to 13 hours on the earbuds themselves, and at least three more full charges in the case. Three LED's on the front give a quick indication of battery life. While talking about the case I shouldn't forget to mention that it has both USB-C as well as wireless charging. That's something even my beloved Linkbuds S doesn't offer.

These are my first dual driver earbuds, and they sound amazing. They are up there with my WF1000-MX4. The separation between bass and treble is great. Vocals and quieter sounds come through clearly.

The active noise canceling is really good, but not quite high-end Sony or Bose good (they are better at that than anybody, including Apple). I do like that it has 3 settings, ANC on, ANC off, and 'Be Aware' (ambient amplification on). There's also a voice that tells you what mode you're in as you switch (I wish it was a hair quieter).

The touch controls are completely customizable, with a ton of settings. You can set 1-tap, 2-tap, 3-tap, and Long press independently on each earbud. I do really like all the default settings though.

$200 is a very fair price for these but I picked mine up for $100 and would recommend doing so immediately if you get the chance."
"The sound quality is closely similar to Soundcore Liberty 3 pro, probably because both has similar dynamic driver/ balanced armature dual design. Liberty 3 pro has louder bass, JLab’s deeper. The mid and high are about the same. Return mine because I received an open box (the eartips is dirty)but paid for new. For that price I can get 4 Liberty 3 pro open boxes from Soundcore direct, enjoy similar sound quality and same 2 years warranty.
I appreciate JLab’s attempt for their first premium earbuds, however market today already crowded with plenty of excellent products from legacy big brands( B&W), Sennheiser, Beyerdynamic and similar up and comers (Soundcore, JLab, Status Between). Status Between sound best (way better than Jlab epic lab） among these three but price in middle， Soundcore has amazing customer service, fast and responsive, much better than JLab. Beyerdynamic is selling their flagship FreeByrd (still sound better than Sonys Xm5 in my opinion) for price similar to the lowest JLab epic sale price, Sennheiser’s MTW 3, the best sounding buds in its gen, can be found almost half price of JLab epic, even B&W Pi7 is cheaper than the Epic when flash sale ( few rounds already). Sorry, ok sound, expensive price, lousy customer support, no JLab."
"I had never owned noise-canceling headphones before, and what a difference it makes. I don't use them in the loudest of environments, but still. I love the feel, the weight, and the fact that they stay in my ear better than others I have had. They stay connected to my tablet as I roam about my workplace, and the battery life, compared to my older Jabras, is amazing. But it is the sound quality that truly sets these apart. Crystal clear, with strong bass and balance. There is no need to spend the extra money on the bigger names; these will make you very happy, I promise you."
"I don’t usually trust all those other reviews written by people who got the product for free being a “Vine reviewer” but I paid out of pocket for these bad boys and I’m not disappointed. I can’t say that I have the Sony wf-1000xm5 or Apple AirPods Pro 2 to compare them to, but I do have Sony wh-1000xm3 over-ear headphones. These little things in the “bass boost” EQ preset are basically on par with the big Sonys on sound quality. Big, warm, rich sound. And unlike the Sony wf-1000xm5 earbuds I keep reading about, these don’t need a “sync button” on the case, because they automatically connect/sync to my iPhone 14 Pro Max, and eachother, almost instantaneously when I take them out of the slick, little cool-to-the-touch metal case. If you can get them on sale $99 or even under $150 I can’t imagine a better value. The dual drivers including 10mm bass driver deliver a sound I doubt you will get from the single 8.4mm driver in the wf-xm5’s. I can’t speak to the Bluetooth call quality because I’m not into phone calls wearing headphones, but the ANC totally tunes out the sound from the air purifier blasting in the corner of my room. Touch controls for volume seem very responsive and deliberate. These might be the new sound King imo."
"The JLabs Epic Lab wireless buds arrived yesterday. I own and have tried a variety of wireless buds including Sony, Bose, Klipsch, Master & Dynamic, and Airpods Pros. While none sound as detailed as high end speakers, or high end headphones, for wireless buds, these are better than the big names sonically. They have good controlled base and relatively clear highs (on the Knowles preferred eq setting). As others have mentioned, the ANC is not as strong, but they also don't create the pressure feeling of stronger ANC. An added bonus is the usb c dongle for use in meetings or in the office without having to pair them. On sale below $130, these are a steal."
"The JLab Epic Lab Edition True Wireless Earbuds redefine audio excellence! With a hybrid dual-driver system, they deliver unparalleled sound quality, balancing crisp highs and deep lows. The ergonomic design ensures a secure fit, and the long battery life keeps the music playing. These earbuds are a true masterpiece for audiophiles and tech enthusiasts alike."
"These are by far the best bud below $300!
Best sound quality under $200 and best ANC I've heard except sony and bose. Would definitely recommend at the sales price! Has LDAC, long battery life, great fit too."
"Los mejores audifonos que he comprado son mucho mejor que samsung y apple
La calidad de sonido y la canselasion de ruido son mucho mejor tube que remplazar mis samsung buds. Por estos. Ahora son mis favorito ya que cuentan con una bateria muy duradera ybestan muy bien diseñados les doy 10 de 10"
I have always loved this brand from my first cheaper pair. The sound quality is always crisp and clear and great bass. Unless I'm super picky I don't have to adjust any EQ settings. The sizes they have are perfect for my weird ear holes too!
"Great quality on the case and the buds. Sound is amazing and ANC is great as well. Very much worth the price, especially when on sale."
These are worth the money
"They sound amazing. But they don't sound great on a ps5 the volume is super low at max volume. Ugh I hate the ps5, it make bluetooth adapters volume too low. This device works well on PC though. Don't buy for the stupid ps5."
Worth the investment! I'm loving these JLab buds!
"Queria darle una oportunidad a esta marca y en realidad Quería que me gustaran pero nisiquiera pude llegar a saber como suenan nunca logré, nunca pide llegar a conecatar ambos a la vez, solo se conectaba el izquierdo y cuando no se conectaba el izquierdo se conectaba solo el derecho pero nunca ambos a las vez esto nunca me había pasado en auriculares de este rango de precio solo en los que son bien baratitos....
A parte de eso la construcción esta ok, nada para tirar cohetes pero siento siente sólidos y el estuche tiene buen peso aunque un poco grande para mi gusto no son tan grandes y sentí cómodo en el corto periodo que los utilizo lo único que no me gusta es que sobresalen un poco de las orejas pero no son incomodos...
No los pude utilizar por el problema de conexión y los devolví de inmediato me sentí muy frustrado 😖 por dicho problema perdieron su oportunidad conmigo....gracias por nada"
"These earbuds sound great fit really good they have all the bells and whistles well worth $200 the best I've owned and I've owned a lot of sets, great sound quality!!"
"Everything is good, but it is a bit heavy and the earphone is hard to take out from the case"
"My boyfriend bought me these earbuds cause I have a habit of misplacing things all the time.
they have a find my device on them. The only problem is that only the right one rings. The ring is also supposed to get louder as it rings doesn't do that either otherwise they are pretty good I'm disappointed though I had to look for an hour to actually find the left"
These earbuds are great.. especially if you can get them for the low price of $99. Happy listening.
I love the feel of these despite being a bit bigger than I would like. They have amazing sound quality and have lots of customization options
"These absolutely destroy my airpods quality wise. Great sound, LOUD too, feel good to wear"
"Excellent quality, noise cancellation is superb. Clarity of sound is great."
Amazing sound. The balanced drives were amazing until the right bud died out of no where. 3 months after purchase. Hoping for warranty replacement but not holding my breath
"They worked great for the first 2 or 3 months.

A little over a month ago the volume quality began to fade. Two days ago the left earbud stopped working completely..."
The battery dies if you leave them in a hot car. And I mean dies completely. I've had them a few months and they stopped charging. Do not get them.
Mediocre audio quality and they fall out very easily (yes i put on the correct size rubber tips for my ears)
"The charging is not easy , and that was a deal killer. If that does not bother you, then they are reasonable"
"Bought 12/7/2023, Christmas gift for my niece. 2/14/2024, case is charged according to the lights. The ear buds will not charge. Not a cheap product but obviously cheap."
I feel like this product fell short of what was advertised
"These little jokers will blow you away. The price alone had me, I can’t believe the amount of money I’ve spent on expensive BUL-SHYT earbuds. Then these came along. Nice fit, connected quickly, value unbeatable, great performance, basic on the color but who gives a crap these things happen to sound great without the app. Versatility superb."
"I really like these earbuds. The sound quality is incredible. That is all I like though. The package comes with many different size bud covers but no matter what size I chose they kept falling out of my ears. I even had a friend try them for a day and he had the same issue. The only person they fit was a 13 year old boy.

I'm bummed because the sound quality is amazing and at this price you want to enjoy your music or phone call without the fear of losing one randomly."
"Please keep in mind, I’m no headphone expert. I’m just a girl that likes to listen to music. My ears may not hear the slight subtleties in sound quality that others may hear loud and clear.

Bluetooth setup was really easy. I don’t want to bother with any earbuds that always have issues with Bluetooth connection. I want it to connect as quick and simply as possible. That’s what happened with these, I just open it and put one or both buds in my ears and I’m ready to go.

I usually use a pair of wireless earbuds that are not noise cancelling. They are from a very popular company that sells everything from phones, tablets, laptops, to watches. You probably know the exact ones I use. That is all I can really compare them to as they are the ones I’m most familiar with.

As soon as I received these JLabs, I got them out and started seeing which bud “heads” fit my ear the best. After all, I like the ones I usually use because they are comfortable and I can wear them forever. I found that the foam buds work by far the best for noise cancelling. The noise cancelling is amazing, might I add. I never knew the absence of sound would be something I liked so much. The foam buds are not the most comfortable, however. I found myself getting a little wear fatigued if I wear them for too long. I like the smallest rubber/silicone buds for regular daily listening. They also do a fairly good job at noise cancelling, just not as good as the foam buds.

I was surprised to receive these already charged up a significant amount. That leads into another very important factor with wireless earbuds: the battery. These have a fantastic battery, especially in comparison to the ones I have now. I don’t like having to worry about charging stuff, and with these I don’t have to worry for at least a week or two, depending on how much I’m using them.

Lastly, the quality. Again, I’m no expert. These sound pretty good to me. I would say the noise cancelling enhances my listening experience and makes the quality better.

Also, JLab has an app called JLab where you can update the software on your earbuds. They make it very simple to do so. You can also change the settings for tapping your earbuds to do different things. Of course you can also change the sound settings as well. It’s very customizable."
"These are exceptional earbuds, with clear thought and care apparent at every step of the process. The design is slick, effective and functional. The sound is punchy and fun , yet still detailed - these are the first earbuds I’ve tested in a long while that go toe to toe on sound with Apple’s own flagship earbuds.

They are packaged in recyclable cardboard, nested in a pleasingly hefty metal charging case, and come with 6 sets of ear tips (3 silicone, 3 memory foam) so you can get a fit and sound signature to your liking. This was a welcome surprise for me, as I far prefer the sound with foam tips, and usually end up buying them separately. The case itself also has small LED lights that show you the state of charge of the case and whether the earbuds are charging in the case, and can itself be charged wirelessly and via an included USB-C cable. In a word, these earbuds are indeed epic.

Pairing is simple and effortless on Apple devices, with instant recognition every time I’ve taken them from their case. The companion app is not required to use them, but it does unlock extra capabilities, allowing you to customize the touch commands and adjust sound settings, including ANC. Speaking of which, the ANC and Be Aware (letting outside sound through) settings are adjustable and remarkably effective - I’ve found traffic noise, construction sounds and kitchen noises all melt away with ANC activated, while Be Aware is on a par with any pass-through functionality I’ve used (I hope it is made adaptive in future firmware releases!).

The sound is a joy. I tend to like headphones and earbuds that are on the dynamic side, rather than a “neutral” sound, and these wowed me right out of the box. Listening my way through my test playlist (which includes everything from classical to Kendrick), I was impressed by the sound - low end punch and clean but not overly bright highs. The dual drivers can create some serious magic. The sound stage is broad for earbuds, with plenty of breathing room and sparkle to “Philosophise In It! Chemicalize With It!” by Kishi Bashi, while still being able to dial in the sound - “Make Me Feel” by Janelle Monae was tight intimate funk. I would say they can create the same range of dynamics as the AirPod 2 Pros, but the Epics makes it a lot more fun - more thump, more contrast. The included USB-C dongle is also a great included option - I can finally have wireless sound on my Switch without extra gear, and I look forward to listening to Bluetooth LC as it is rolled out for common use.

The mics are good. Voice got good feedback from calls I’ve taken, though general consensus was that my AirPods still have the edge on that front. These are comfortable to long wear sessions though, and unlike my AirPods, can survive a full day with ANC running without being dead by late afternoon.

All in all, these are excellent earbuds, and a huge leap forward for JLab."
"I really like these JLab Epic Lab Edition earbuds. They've done a great job of implementing multiple drivers (for a more rich sound that reproduces high and low frequencies well), adding proximity sensing to each bud to detect insertion, having a functional app that's clearly laid out, and implemented multi-pair well. I've found it handy to use with both my cell phone and laptop paired over Bluetooth.

The case feels like a very high quality metal with rubber bumper at the bottom and built-in Qi charging. The LED indicators on the front are nice and intuitive. I do find it a little tricky to remove the docked buds because there's not much to grip, but pulling them towards the front of the case seems to work the best. The case holds the buds as well as the USB C dongle that's a quick way to connect to a computer (although a USB A to C dongle would be worth having for all the computers that lack USB C out there).

The headphones come with 3 sizes of memory foam tips and 3 sizes of silicone tips. I found the silicone tips fairly comfortable but the heavier earbuds would start to loosen while I was eating. The memory foam tips are thinner and somewhat tricky to install, but worth the effort because squeezing them down and installing resulted in a seal that withstood eating/chewing motions as well. These IEMs are a bit too bulky and expensive for me to use them while walking around the neighborhood, but the tight grip of the foam tips might make that a bit less risky. Personally, I prefer having a cheaper/expendable pair of earbuds for when I'm walking around and the nice set can live at the desk/stay home.

I haven't had any issues with battery life and that's very welcome. I did find that pairing the earbuds with multiple Bluetooth devices probably wasn't described well. You need to remove the earbuds from the case to initiate the 2nd pairing. I found the app very useful for having noise cancelling fine tuning with a slider, which helped reduce the ""white noise fog"" I was feeling when the slider was on full strength. With the slider on full-power (the default), I found that Be Aware (of surroundings) mode was so strong I was hearing my own pulse. However, wind noises may still be problematic with the filtering algorithms employed and I found myself just relying on the foam tips and noise control turned off accomplished a lot of noise blocking.

My only real concern is that the $200 price is a stretch compared to headphones I usually wear. But these are also my favorite pair of IEMs now."
"I got these for my 20yro daughter and she loves them. She had to the change the ear pads a couple of times to get just the right feel, but there's plenty to choose from.
The sound quality is awesome the vocals are very clear and the bass is perfect. Completely noise canceling. They paired to all my devices with no problems and all the features work well."
Very good and I have 5 sets of different earbud sets. VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE.
"I think these are some fantastic Bluetooth earbuds. I think their sound quality is well above average and they are feature rich.

Summary
- I think they have amazing audiophile level sound quality and are fun to listen to
- The microphone sounds great on voice calls
- They are fully customizable using the JLabs app

Full Review

I have been using a pair of mid-level Sennheiser audiophile headphones for several years, and a pair of Edifier NEO Buds Pro. Those two are comparable in price and sound quality. These JLabs earbuds are in the same category, and I think they bring a lot to the user experience

Fit
- They seal into the ear canal, and they feel secure most of the time.
- They are lightweight and I have not felt any discomfort after using them all day for video conference calls and listening to music

Sound Quality
- The dual driver provides an incredibly detailed and rich listening experience. There are three built in sound profiles (JLabs Signature, Balanced, Bass boost, and Custom). The custom profile allows you to use an EQ in the app.
- For the music I listen to, I prefer the JLabs Signature profile, as it has a bit more bass than the Balanced profile.
- The highs are very detailed, clear, and clean to me. They overdone and I didn’t experience any fatigue after a full day listening to music.
- The mid range is only slightly diminished, but still clear and detailed. The mids are not as present as I would like, but they still sound great. I believe this is how JLabs set up their DSP profiles and is not a limitation of the earbuds.
- The lows are detailed, punchy and full, and are not muddy.

Noise Cancellation
- These earbuds have decent active noise cancellation. It removes some background sound, mostly in the low end. I can still hear more sound that I would prefer when no music is playing.
- You can control the level of noise cancellation in the JLabs app.
- The sound quality does not change with ANC on or off.

Phone Feature
- These earbuds do a decent job with calls on the phone and conferencing on the computer. In my testing, the other people said they sounded very good. My voice was very full and strong, with no background noise.

Battery Life
- I was able to use these earbuds non-stop for 7-8 hours for video conferencing and listening to music. I had the noise canceling on and off throughout the day.
- I have tested them for a few days, connected to my computer and my phone. I switched between listening to music and being on conference video calls.
- The earbud recharge time is pretty fast, so I can give the earbuds a quick charge and keep using them. The case holds a lot of charge, so I was able to get multiple recharges from the case.

Other Features
- During a conference call on my computer, I noticed that the volume changed when the noise in my environment went up and down. I think that is very cool.
- All the taps and long presses on the earbuds are fully customizable
- They support dual pairing, so I can have them connected to my laptop and phone at the same time

Verdict
- Overall, I think this pair of Bluetooth earbuds have an incredible level of sound quality - definitely in the audiophile level. They are feature rich and easy to use. For the price, I think they provide great value. They are my go-to earbuds."
"Best earbuds I’ve ever had! The EQ in the app made me tear up, this is how music should sound all the time!"
"JLab Epic Lab Edition True Wireless Earbuds, Hybrid Dual Drivers, Spatial Audio, Bluetooth LE Audio, Multipoint BT, Wireless or USB-C Charging, Wear Detect Auto Play/Pause, Google Fast Pair

I have always been a wired headphone purest. I do see a benefit to wireless but sound is often very important to me and the ones I tried before this were just not acceptable. In addition I have been over sensitive to many noise cancelling headphones in the past. I am often able to hear the cancelling signal in my eardrum. None of that happens with these. the noise cancelling is silent and the dual driver sound is very, very good. With android they just pair immediately and the android OS communicates directly with them. Also with android you get high quality LDAC transmission for higher quality audio than normal bluetooth. On iOS they pair very easily also and use AAC encoding for high quality audio. On PC or Mac there is a dongle for immediate pairing and low latency transmission. The Bass hits well and is very clean never muddy, evan with the bass enhanced EQ setting, and the highs are handled very well with the Balanced Armature driver. The EQ works well to customize your sound profile. I like either the Bass enhanced or the JLab signature for presets. Also the ""Be Aware"" passthrough mode works amazingly well. I use this mode most often at work and it sounds great. It sounds like open back headphones and is very natural. It does not sound like amplified outside sound. The noise cancelling works remarkably well and does not bother my eardrums the way some do. They just work. I have several pairs of wired in ear monitors with multiple drivers and these come very close in sound quality. The spacial audio is also fantastic for video games. Overall these are the most impressive wireless earbuds I have yet tried. Sound quality is top notch and for me beats the heck out of airpods. I am grateful to have these and I highly recommend them."
"Based on sound quality and comfort, these are definitely worth a 5 star review and are easily the nicest ear buds I have owned (though, for the price, they should be). Even at their default settings, from an audio quality standpoint, these have more bass than any of my others -- by far. The treble and overall tonal quality are also great. As a test, I pulled out my old Cincinnati Pops Time Warp album, which to this day still has some of the best dynamic ranges of any I own. These are the first ear buds I have had that actually let me enjoy the full range of that music. Everything sounded the way it should and the low bass was actually present. Being ear buds, I still miss the FEEL of the low bass that you get from a set of large external speakers, but for ear buds, these are about as good as you are going to get. They also are very comfortable to wear and the standard medium silicone pads fit me perfectly (it also come with several different sizes and styles for people with different size ears).

Another things that I like about these are that the App allows fully customizing all the button press options to your own preferences and, for a change, it has a full equalizer with full customization. As I am getting older and my ears don't respond quite as well in certain frequency ranges as they used to (high treble), I like being able to customize it to my preferences, and these give me that option (which a lot of audio equipment this day and age does not). I also like that it comes with a dedicated USB dongle that I can plug into my desktop or laptop without having to deal with Bluetooth pairing. That being said, I tested these out with both Bluetooth and the dongle on my desktop and couldn't tell any difference audio quality wise. They also paired right up with my phone and the sound quality was great their too. For on the road use, I like that the carrying case has enough battery capacity for multiple charges of the earbuds themselves. I also like that it has wireless charging capability (which I really wish more things had).

All that being said, I'm picky, and I still have a few minor complaints about these. First off, as I mentioned, I'm older and I have arthritis and the way these fit into the case and have no edges or grips at all makes it quite difficult for me to remove them from the carrying case. The sides are slick with no place to get hold of and when you have fingers that don't like exerting a lot of pressure to grip them, it makes it very uncomfortable trying to pull them out. Second, while these ear buds fit my ears nicely and are very comfortable, the placement of the button on the end is not the most ergonomic. I have to basically angle the ear buds downwards into what is a slightly less comfortable position to even really be able to access it (otherwise it is blocked by my ear itself). Even once positioned to where I can reach it (awkwardly), the double and triple button presses simply do not work reliably. Single and long press work fine, but double and triple rarely do. My final complaint would be with the charging cable and the audio dongle: they are USB-C only. For the price, you would think they could also include a USB-A to C adapter, as there are still WAY more USB-A devices and chargers out there than there are USB-C (especially for the dongle). I have adapters so this didn't cause me any major headaches, but I think they still should include one.

Even with the minor ergonomic and button press issues, I still think these are fully worthy of 5 stars and happily recommend them. Essentially, they sound great and have no pairing issues, which is what really matters for ear buds!"
"I was truly blown away by the sound quality when I first tried these. I have spent most of my life thinking ""sound is sound, there can't be that much difference in quality"" and these are the headphones that showed me I was wrong. I low end bass from these was incredible and sounded a way I've only ever heard when I got a good subwoofer to add to my record player's speakers. It came through in a way that my cheap and even other $200 buds that are losing their battery after a few years have never produced.
These buds are very comfortable to wear. Most modern buds are at this point after whatever technological development came along in the last 5 years or so that internal buds are comfortable in a way they never were before, but rest assured these are that comfortable but plus a feature: JLab provides numerous options for the earpiece for these. They have 3 sizes of silicon, plus 3 sizes of foam and you can pick what you want. This is perfect for me, my ears are different sizes and one can't hold silicon earpieces in but the foam stays, so I can now actually put in my one medium and one small foam earpieces for the perfect fit, and I find the foam does much better for noise cancelling.
The battery power on these is phenomenal. I haven't drained them yet, but I definitely would have drained any other pair of buds I've ever owned for all I've used them. They feel good, and the case feels good. What I mean is a perfect sturdy metal heavyness. It feels like if I dropped it, I'd be more worried about my floor and not at all about the case. These are all around amazing."
"The JLab Epic Lab Edition earbuds are an excellent choice all around. The earbuds feature superior active noise cancelation while also providing rich high-quality sound with great bass. The battery life of the earbuds is greater than any others I have used and the listing description of 56 hours is not unrealistic. The case for the earbuds also adds charging to the earbuds and the case can either be charged via USB-C or via wireless charging. The case also includes a USB-C Bluetooth dongle which with some testing, seems to work well although my normal connection is via the Bluetooth already built into my system. The JLab app works well to allow for customization of equalizer settings and earbud controls as well as monitoring charge level of the earbuds. I found the price to be reasonable for the quality of earbuds received."
"In many ways they are epic, for sure. This is a well-rounded package with a lot of features and I can see how they will make a lot of users very happy. As far as the sound signature and the presets go there is something wild going on here. The ""balanced"" preset must be a joke! I have never heard more extreme ""balanced"" preset in my life. What the Jlab people conisder ""balanced"" is going to be very crazy tuning for a lot of us - especially those who truly prefer REAL balanced sound... haha. Having said that- I don't really see this as a flaw. There's an extensive EQ that you can use to fine tune them yourself and change the sound any way you see fit. Luckily, the EQ is quite responsive and moving the sliders in the app up and down actually makes a lot of a difference.

Other features: I would rate the ANC pretty high compared to all competition. Well done!

Ergonomics are great, IMHO. While they are not my all-time favorite earbud shape they fit well and do not fall out of my ears. The fitment and removing them from the case is a whole different story and this is one area that almost makes me want to ding a star = removing them from the case is unnecessarily DIFFICULT! For people with thicker fingers this will be a nightmare scenario. No earbuds ever should require people to reach for a screw driver (or other tools) just to remove them from the charging case!

Looks are great and one of the strongest points - it's pretty hard to stand out from the ocean of the same looking products but these do a decent job as far as original looks.

Overall, i would say they are worth the price and a great alternative to all other brands selling at this level. I can see how they will make a lot of users very happy."
The right ear bud is very sensitive when adjusting in my ear. It will pause and turn the music up and down just from slight adjustment. it also slides out of my right ear a lot. Still a nice set tho and would recommend just make sure you adjust the size.
"My wife's airpods were on their last battery leg. She would have been happy to get the 3rd generation airpods but the price for those, and all Apple products, can be difficult to justify when you can find the same, if not better quality, in a less expensive earbuds. I saw these and asked her if she'd like to give them a try.
The battery life is excellent. That alone makes them a good buy. The sound is exceptional - just as good as the airpods - if not better. They pair effortlessly with her iphone. To sum this up, she loves them EXCEPT for one small issue that I need to include in this review. They are difficult to remove from the case. The earbuds are held in the case magnetically. I can see where that may be a good thing. The magnets provide for a good charging connection and will hold the earbuds in the case if the case is dropped. The issue is removing them. Simply pulling up on the buds isn't enough to break the magnetic bond. The only way to remove them is to pull up from the side, and it is best to use a fingernail. This may not be much of a problem for someone with small fingers, but this could be an issue for someone with arthritis."
"I am shocked at how good these are. I genuinely think I prefer them over some of the bigger name brand wireless earbuds I own! The case is a reasonable size, the earbuds have some bulk but are not at all uncomfortable, and they don't stick out too far to look weird in your ear. They fit me very well, and as most earbuds do, they came with a variety of sizes (and types) to choose from. The app is nice and straightforward to use, and the earbuds have all sorts of customizations for how to control them via tapping or holding your finger on them. You can set up various EQ settings with pretty specific controls, which is really cool. The ANC is pretty good for earbuds, but obviously they won't be as good as high-end over-ear headphones would be. They connect pretty quickly, and seamlessly switch between two devices playing audio. I also love that they use Bluetooth LE audio, and they have gone as far as including a USB-c dongle so you can take advantage of the better audio standard even on computers or devices that don't support it. The battery life on these is also amazing, lasting many hours of active use, and a LOT more hours when charging via the case. I am so happy I got these, and I can gladly recommend them to others looking for a great pair of wireless earbuds!!"
"Let's start with small, but amazing:
When you take the one out of your right ear (or it falls out, as sometimes happens with earbuds) whatever you're listening to pauses immediately.
They are Bluetooth earbuds AND ( I really want some italics - all caps makes me feel rude, but recognizable emphasis is sometimes required) they have a dongle. I know, you're wondering what the big deal is. The big deal is that the dongle has priority over the Bluetooth settings when it is in use. So....you can plug the dongle into your PC/laptop to watch Netflix, or whatever, then put it back in the case when you're done and be instantly reconnected to your phone. No more swapping headphones, no more unpairing and re-pairing. Just quick, easy listening every time.
Not only do they have incredible noise-canceling ability, but there is a setting you can choose in the app (yep, they have an app) to allow ambient sound through, almost as if you weren't wearing them at all.
The sound is fantastic. With three EQ presets and the ability to set a custom fourth, I don't think there's any way not to get the perfect sound for you.

Update: Oh my god, I completely forgot the WIRELESS CHARGING! The case is on my Android phone's wireless charger topping off RIGHT NOW, while I'm listening to some tunes. UN-FREAKING BELIEVEABLE.

WORTH EVERY PENNY OF THE PRICE."
"I had an older version of some JLab wireless earbuds, that I have loved for years. I was very excited to try these new Epic Lab Edition earbuds. I have NOT been disappointed. They are an upgrade in about every way. The sound is as good if not better than my Beats earbuds from 2020. Battery life is acceptable/good. The features are what put these earbuds over the top. They are in a higher price range than I'm usually comfortable with, but I feel that you are getting what you pay for. Absolutely would order more if I needed another pair!"
"The JLab Epic Lab Edition True Wireless Earbuds set a new standard in the audio experience. Featuring hybrid dual drivers and spatial audio, they deliver rich, immersive sound quality that brings music and media to life. The incorporation of Bluetooth LE Audio and Multipoint BT technology ensures seamless connectivity and easy switching between devices. These earbuds are designed for convenience with options for both wireless and USB-C charging, catering to various user preferences. The wear detect auto play/pause feature adds a layer of intuitiveness, pausing audio automatically when removed. Additionally, the Google Fast Pair functionality makes connecting to devices effortless. Ideal for tech enthusiasts and audiophiles, these earbuds offer a blend of advanced features, superior sound quality, and user-friendly design. Comparing these to airpods is laughable because these sound so much better it's like comparing dollar store earbuds to professional sound engineer equipment,."
"I will say i get it now this brand is known for audio for a reason! These are my new favorite and go to set! The audio is amazing the tech in this is crazy. This will automatically find my phone and my phone asks to connect. Easiest and best setup ever. plus if it doesn't work for your device it has bluetooth, and it also has a receiver to use so no matter what you should be good to go! This also has a customizable eq know that i know those exist i won't accept a headset without it! The battery life is great never died on me please know i an kinda ocd with charging though. So when i finish using it i tend to always fill up after each use. I got tired of days revolving around everything i own needing charged. No complaints if i could give 6 stars i would. from now on this will be my go to brand hopefully they continue to make quality products like this! Lastly the noise cancelation did wonderfully anytime i can't hear my roommate's but hear music or my game only i am happy!"
"First impression was that the container is absolute high quality. It came fully charged too. The container has a weight too it and very solid. I initially had issues picking up the earpieces out of the container as it’s difficult to grip and had dropped one in the process but no damage as they are small. Has a usb-c dongle to directly attach to a pc or android or maybe an iPhone 15, I haven’t confirmed that. Very easy to pair with my iPhone 14 Pro via Bluetooth. Sound quality is top notch. Just putting in the earpieces blocks a lot of the ambient sound around me. Music sounds very clear with some good bass and vocals. Some different EQ settings can be changed by tapping the earpiece 3 times. There’s also an app to try and configure to optimize the sound. Overall, this does feel high end and the sound is very good. Recommend."
"This is a quality set of earbuds that is impressive on many levels.

The actual build of the set - case and earbuds - is superb and designed to last and they have a sleek and minimalist look.

Pairing was easy with Apple products and the sound is excellent! The noise cancelling aspect is designed to be intuitive and adapt to your environment and this allows the sound to shine! This also makes it excellent for travel as it takes out all the plane noise.

They have a great for fit and include multiple earbud tips ( including non silicone for those with sensitivities ) and having tested them through a work out and fast run, they stay in place and hold up to tough workouts.

Great earbuds with excellent sound and quality !"
I have to say I am impressed by these ear phones. Like they are 100% worth the money. The build quality is good and it has a lot of options for ear sizes. It has a rubber ear piece to fit everyone. Do yourself a favor and fit them when you first get them and you won't have a problem with them falling out. I like the included dongle so you can use them with your phone but also the computer. So convenient to have them connect to multiple devices with no interference. I use them with my phone and my Xreal AR glasses so when I watch a movie you can have great sound. The sound quality really is there and I would put them on par with my Samsung buds.
"I had very high expectations for earbuds that’s cost this much. I’ve been using my AirPods for a couple years and thought they were great, and these cost quite a bit more. After using these, I now realize that these are well worth it if you want better quality sound and better durability. I’m beyond impressed with the sound quality and the noise cancelling ability of these! Right off the bat, I could tell they were made very well and with quality materials. The case is very sturdy and they also hold a charge for an incredibly long time. These are now my new go to earbuds."
"I ordered this for my husband and he's quite the audiophile. He has some other earbuds that were far more costly by a very well-regarded brand known for sound. He was absolutely surprised at how good these buds are and found that they're extremely close in quality to his more expensive, well-regarded brand name buds. The noise canceling function is excellent. The app is easy to use and offers multiple equalizer features. They are also very comfortable, offering multipe ear bud sizes and styles. The sound is excellent and my husband was pleasantly surprised by these. While he wasn't familiar with this brand before, he has been extremely impressed."
I'm very happy with the quality of these earbuds and just how great the sound is that comes from them. They're very small and compact and the case is smooth and has a soft finish. The battery lasts a lot longer than other bluetooth headphones I have.
Work great! I have only have to charge once a week! Case shows your battery right on the front! Noise cancelation works well! Comfortable in your ear. Plenty loud enough! Great for the price! Comes with lots of ear pieces! Adults and kids the same!
"So much better sound quality than Apple. These things are absolutely fantastic probably the best sounding wireless earbuds I have heard. The build quality is fantastic.

These allow you to also connect to the computer with the dongle which is a really handy thing to have.

The craftsmanship on these earbuds is readily apparent and they are so worth the price. These are audiophile headphones with amazing low end and really high resolution on the mids. They have plenty of power and sound just fantastic."

"I purchased these elsewhere but felt compelled to come onto Amazon to write a review and let people know just how good these earbuds are. In this review, I will focus only on the sound as that is the most important thing to me.

Before I continue let me lay the background of my earbud history so you can gauge the value of my opinion for yourself. I'm not a collector of earbuds however I have owned a few stellar pairs along the way. Prior to the Jlabs I was using the Sony WF-1000xm3 which I still own. In the past, I've owned IEMs from Sure, namely the 535 and 846. Both are amazing IEMs, especially the 846. Unfortunately the trade-off between wired and wireless became too big considering my lifestyle, hence I started using TWSs. Was there a drop in sound quality - you bet! It's a price I sadly had to pay.

I purchased the Jlabs due to the battery on the xm3s deteriorating to the point of only lasting 5 minutes at a time. I was also considering the xm5s. I went with the Jlabs as the dual driver setup with an armature driver seemed very promising. The Sure IEMs that I owned in the past used armature drivers exclusively and the crispness of sound and separation were unmatched.

Now coming to the Jlabs. The sound blew me away. I was not expecting them to sound this good! The music that comes out of these has so much depth. Previously whenever I used my laptop I would reach for my Beyerdynamic DT 770 headphones to enjoy the relaxed wide soundstage that it provides. Now that I have the Jlabs my Beyerdynamics are collecting dust.

Let me try and break down what makes these sound so good. The separation between all the elements in the song is very clean. You can hear everything distinctly and in its own space. To put that into perspective, think of watching a low-quality video. You might be able to make out everything in the video but the detail will be lacking. Now contrast that to a 4k video. Not only can you make out everything but also in great detail. The edges of all the subjects in the frame are very well-defined. There's a clear separation and distinction between everything. Nothing's soft, fuzzy or blurs into something else. These earbuds sound like 4k and I'm sure that has to do with the armature driver handling the mid to high frequencies. As for the soundstage which I mentioned earlier, it's great, especially for earbuds of this size. The music is happening around you as opposed to being fed into your ear.

Moving on to the bass. This time round I really wanted a pair of earbuds that could produce some solid bass. The xm3s were a disappointment in this regard but that might be because I owned the Sure 846 in the past. They contained an engineered subwoofer which was nothing short of amazing. Did the Jlabs disappoint? Nope, they are solid when it comes to bass. They have a satisfying thump when reproducing kicks and pleasing low rumble on bass lines. I could not ask for more at this price range. The bass also has depth. You can hear the separation between the kick and the bass line and they sit low in the sound stage with the bass line a bit further back in the mix (in general).

To finish this review I'm going to compare the Jlabs to the xm3s which were Sony's flagship a few years back and received flattering reviews from all the major publications and tech influencers. They were a big deal in the TWS space at the time. I must add here that I ordered some replacement batteries for the xm3s at the same time when I purchased the Jlabs. I have since replaced the batteries in the xm3s and they're good to go again but they won't be going anywhere except into the drawer where they will be forgotten. After using the Jlabs the Sony's feel like watching HD video compared to 4k. The music is 2 dimensional and is clearly being fed into my ear by the earbuds. To put it simply, compared to the Jlabs, the xm3s sound dull and boring. I did A/B testing and couldn't believe just how much better the Jlabs made everything sound.

So there you have it. I highly recommend these earbuds. Here's a tip, set the EQ to the Knowles Preferred Curve. This EQ was masterfully set by the Knowles team who manufacture the armature drive in these buds. Don't let these be the best buds you've never tried. We need to get behind this offering from Jlabs so that they will continue producing future iterations of these amazing TWS for us to enjoy.

And just so you know, this is a genuine review. I did not receive any free products nor am I sponsored. I purchased the Jlabs with my own money from their website."
"Did a lot of research to find the best Is true wireless ear buds for me. All of my experience with ear buds Has been cheap but high quality earbuds like the taotronic soundlibertys. These are very impressive. One of the things I really like is the metal case most your buds , even if they Come from some more expensive brands still have plastic cases with Plastic hinges. That's one of those things.I really liked about the apple airpods. They had a plastic shell But they had a metal hinge. But me using android almost exclusively I just didn't really want an airpods Because I wouldn't get the benefits of the apple ecosystem. I saw an ad for these on YouTube. 1 day and I thought it looked pretty good. Watch the bunch of reviews and then pay day came around and I figured I'd give them a try. I've been blown away. For the past week I've been using these. I'm really happy.To have true wireless earbuds.Because before this my only way to listen to music after I lost my soundlibertys was my pair of wireless Audio Technicas. Those also sound great but a bit much to cary around everywhere. But now these. And they sound just as great as them. With a smaller footprint."

"I would have never thought that my favorite pair of earbuds would be made by JLab and not one of the well known big brands out there. Let me just say this pair hits all the marks:

Sound 10/10 - Everything sounds good and the presets have a sound for everyone. Mine personally is Bass Boost.
Noise Cancelling 9/10 - I vacuumed the floor with these buds in and could barely hear the vacuum cleaner.
Hear Through 7.5/10 - You can easily hear your surroundings but you do need to have the music volume turned down if the person is not close to you. But a good thing is that you don't hear your steps when you walk on any mode!
Case 10/10 - The case is metal and very premium feeling in the hands with wireless charging!
That BASS!!! 10/10 - If you're a basshead like myself, these knock it out the park👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽!
Soundstage 10/10 - These buds shine when playing Hip Hop or any bass heavy music with clarity in the mids and high and a very dynamic soundstage!
Phone Calls 10/10 - There are no issues with sound going or coming on phone calls and handles background noise very well.
Battery life 10/10 - I listen to my buds at least 4 to 5 hours a day and didn't have to charge up my case for a whole week.

I really enjoy these buds and they have temporarily ended my quest for the best earbuds ever. Right now these are #1 and if you have read this far, just go ahead and buy them. I personally promise you will enjoy these. I have at least 12 pair of earbuds from AirPod Pro's to Sennheiser and on and on. I'm very impress with JLAB for these!"
"The preset eqz sound great but once you go in and customize the sound on the app you can really ger these sounding amazing.

Sound clarity: 10
Bass: 10
Battery: 10
Volume: 8
Fit and comfort: 8.5
Call quality: 9

"Ok, let's get it out of the way, I love trying new headphones and earbuds. I consider myself pretty discerning with audio and typically will only buy something that has been reviewed by soundguys or rtings because they don't just give ""opinions"" on what they hear, but instead use equipment to test audio performance.

I have had/used a wide range of brands from budget to more expensive. My current go-to's have been Bose QC II earbuds and Pixel Buds Pros. These wireless earbuds were very intriguing to try with dual drivers (also considered new xMEMs options available), but based on other reviews I tried these first.

My Initial Experience:

Out of the box, I tried the large foam tips. They were ok, and I initially was not too thrilled with the sound quality, but then decided to go to the large silicone tips. Wow. Huge difference. Sound quality immediately went up. I then downloaded the JLab app and tried the EQ I was most interested in, the ""Knowles"" preset. Double Wow. These things were really starting to impress.

Audio Quality:

Fast forward with hours of listening over a few weeks and I think the sound actually improved even further, after a possible break-in of the drivers. I didn't think it would be possible, but these have definitely surpassed the audio quality of my Bose QC II earbuds. My opinion is based on using the ""Knowles"" EQ preset. Every instrument is separated and heard clearly. Everything is balanced where it should be in the mix. Bass is powerful and still balanced without overpowering. They sound amazing, but I will say, you need to get the right fit with the silicone tips!

Noise Cancellation:

This is the area where they show up as mediocre. With noise cancelling off, they actually have pretty good passive isolation, but when turning noise cancelling on, it only barely improves, maybe 5-10 decibels, to my ears. Decent enough passive isolation makes up for it somewhat, but they are more like tier 2/3 and not at the same level of ANC leaders, as others have stated.

Overall:

To keep this relatively short, I would highly recommend these for their audio quality alone. They also hit on quality feel and features (multipoint, battery life, wireless charging, etc) besides noise cancellation being mediocre. They also stay securely in my ears, which is not the case with the Pixel Buds Pros. Did I mention how good these sound? Like, really, really good for the price (especially if you can nab them on sale). These will be my new daily driver and the Bose QC II earbuds will be strictly for ANC duty."
"This is the first headset I've had, and I've had many, but people I speak with say I sound great and they couldn't even tell I was using a headset! I researched Bluetooth earbud headsets for a couple of months before deciding on Jabra elite 8. I wanted good connectivity, better battery life, good fit for my freakishly small ears, and impact resistance because I'm the biggest klutz on the planet. (Before Gorilla Glass, I was the place cellphones went to die!) Admittedly i very rarely listen to music with my earbuds. I use them mostly for phonecalls and listening to podcasts and audiobooks. Music sounds fantastic to me thru them. But I don't have a discerning ear for sound perfection in terms of music. So while they might very well offer competitive sound quality in their class, I can't claim to know they do for sure. I wouldn't know.
For me, They're great, I can connect them to two devices, use them in one or both ears with both offering all features. Plus they're durable, and they charge fast and have much longer battery life than my last 3 headsets. All for a comparable price. Lastly, tho a big one for me, they stay put. Even in my tiny ears!!"
"These headphones are absolutely amazing. They charge quickly and have absolutely amazing battery life. You can leave them in your ears for several hours and they will still work. The case also offers a ton of extra battery life. The headphones come with several adjustable pieces that allow you to size them just right for a snug fit (for noise cancellation). These Raycon Impact Earbuds can connect through Bluetooth to 2 devices at once, which is great, though do be advised it can only listen to the audio of one device at a time.

Definitely worth the money if you are willing to spend the money for a quality pair of headphones."
"The left earbud will not hold a charge. I clean the contact points with a dry brush and wipe them with a clean microfiber cloth. Still, the left earbud will die quickly and refuse to hold a charge. As well, the left ear sound drops off, especially with percussion or bass sounds. I hade hoped to try out raycon as they seemed to get very good reviews. I don't know if I am unlucky or not. But this product doesn't operate well. And that is a shame, because when they first arrived the sound was pleasant. They fit my ears very well. If raycon can fix the left earbud issues this will likely be a fine product."
"As a Navy Sailor I love Raycon products, but these earbuds work especially great! The long battery life and robustness of these earbuds are perfect for rough conditions, while still maintaining a perfect fit and great sound quality. Highly recommended!"
The sound is unbeatable and amazing comfort but the case broke month one and I didn't take them to work it drop it etc. The plastic around the hinge pin broke now the case closes crooked and won't close all the way. But before that 12 out of 10! Or 6 out of 5 stars
"I rolled the dice on the Impact buds from Raycon. Little more money but you immediately see what you've paid for as soon as you open the box. The (charging) case feels so much better than my previous sets. The old ones closed (and stayed closed) with a spring in the case's hinge. Over time, the cap needed help staying completely closed. The Impact case practically slams shut and feels as though it's held closed with a magnet. Very nice improvement. The ear buds themselves look sick. The carbon fiber is a great touch. The addition of adjustable tops/tips is nice too and provides several combinations to fit any ear size or shape. The sound is very good. Not amazing or breath taking... very good. Three different EQ settings for podcasts, bass nuts and audiophile (my preference). Definitely satisfied. Can't wait to hit the gym and mower tomorrow!"
"The audio is good and I don’t have a complaint taking into account they are earbuds. ANC works rather good but could be better, but this may be an issue for me due to poor fit. I would have liked to see an app controlled equalizer like other companies have instead of the presets.
The fit for me is over all bad after working out for a short while I get enough moisture in my ear to the point where the earbuds just pop out of my ear when I’m lifting weight which is very annoying and have to be readjusted after almost every set. I have tried every combination of ear tip and fins available and even looked for larger fins on Raycon’s website. The only way I can get them to work is to stack med and large fins on each other which would be acceptable since I’ve already bought them but unfortunately this isn’t an option due to them being unable to within the case like this and close it. For this reason is why I’m giving them such a poor score for the most part.
The touch button are ok, they don’t respond the best and have left a lot to desire in my opinion. The left earbud button has stopped working all together which means I can’t use any of its features like the equalizer presets. The button stopped working within the first month of owning them unfortunately for no apparent reason. This is the other reason for the bad score.

I really tried to like these earbuds since they sound pretty good and look cool but functionality is more important and I would NOT recommend if your ears are anywhere near the larger side of the scale, I know I have bigger ears but didn’t expect these to be almost unusable. 2/5"
I bought these for the advertised durability and wearability. Unfortunately I can't find a combination of fittings to make them stay in my ear(s) when skin is moist or oily. The fin options are not shaped or sized large enough to secure them in my ears.
Good sound quality.
"First of all, I know the price might be a huge deciding factor BUT…if you have to save alittle money to get these, trust me..you will NOT be disappointed! I just took a leap and got them…

Secondly, straight out of the box, they have a great charge, come with three different sizes for the ear cones and three different sizes of the outer ear grips (look at the pictures of the product, the small bumps above the ear cones have a removable rubber cover, which’s makes these virtually adaptable to ANY ear shape)

Each ear bud has different touch commands, the right bud does the Noise cancellation option and the awareness mode option….I needed them more for awareness mode..( I can be listening to music or audio books and still hear if someone is trying to talk to me or trying to get my attention)

Side note: in order to have the best experience with noise cancellation, just be sure to have to tightest fit for you ear cones to make a good seal.

Indestructible…I’m telling you guys, I’ve been through countless pairs of headphones and ear buds (not to mention iPhones!..lol) anyway, this is the FIRST ever set of earbuds that I can honestly say stand up to the advertising they put out for them. I’ve sat on them, dropped them, got them caught in my recliner…(told ya I’ve been through countless sets, lol) anyway, they keep on keeping on…

Another absolutely amazing feature is the sound quality and OMG, the bass in the buds are truly divine. They could literally replace gamers headphones if a person wanted to switch to them for that.

I’m not a fan of leaving many reviews, but as a YouTuber that’s on literally most of the day everyday, the 90 hour battery life was a huge target for me to try these out also….what can I say…my iPhone always needs to be charged long before these puppies even get to half battery life!!

Better still, these earbuds are comfy…if you are like me and have to pull ear buds out because you ears start to hurt or get sore…(that gets frustrating) you no longer have to worry about that with these bad boys! I forgot I had them in just yesterday..lol..

Other than all of this, they connect quickly to your iPhone or android, literally straight out of the box..you can download the mini users manually if you choose too (I did so I could get used to the settings for each ear bud)

All in all, I saw the few negative reviews for these but still got them, I am sooo happy I did! I was a day on fan before, but believe me, I’m a die hard fan for life now! (If raycon came out with a new iPhone, I’d jump on it too! Lol)

You won’t be sorry, just get these and you’ll see exactly what I’m raving about."
"As a disabled veteran living with PTSD and chronic illness, the Raycon Impact Earbuds have been a game-changer for me. These military-grade impact-resistant earbuds not only provide me with exceptional sound quality and comfort but also help me manage my symptoms and maintain focus during challenging times.

Living with PTSD and chronic illness can often lead to sensory overload and heightened anxiety, making it difficult to concentrate on tasks or find moments of peace. The Active Noise Cancellation feature of the Raycon Impact Earbuds has been a lifesaver for me, allowing me to block out external distractions and create a calming environment wherever I go. This feature has significantly reduced my anxiety levels and helped me stay focused on my daily activities, whether I'm working, exercising, or simply relaxing.

In addition to the noise-canceling feature, the stereo sound quality of these earbuds is truly impressive. The clear and immersive audio experience enhances my music listening, podcast enjoyment, and phone calls, providing me with a sense of comfort and joy during challenging moments. The 90 hours of battery life is also a huge plus, as I can rely on these earbuds for extended periods without worrying about constantly recharging them.

From a Christian perspective, the gospel message of Jesus Christ reminds me that even in the midst of struggles and hardships, there is hope, peace, and comfort to be found. The Raycon Impact Earbuds serve as a tangible reminder of God's presence in my life, providing me with a sense of calm and focus as I navigate my journey with PTSD and chronic illness. Just as these earbuds help me tune out distractions and focus on what truly matters, the message of Jesus Christ invites me to turn my gaze towards Him and find solace in His love and grace.

Overall, I highly recommend the Raycon Impact Earbuds to any disabled veteran, individual living with PTSD or chronic illness, or anyone seeking high-quality audio and noise-canceling capabilities. These earbuds have truly made a difference in my life, allowing me to find moments of peace, focus, and joy amidst life's challenges."
"I've been using these for awhile now and I really like them best over all the other Raycon's I've owned. Great battery life, people understand me on the phone. If there was a downside, the indicator for when the battery is dying isn't very noticeable and like all other Raycon's I've had. You have very little time left when you do get the low battery indicator."
"I honestly didnt really know what to expect from these when i got them.... I was worried about sound quality, I was worried about fit, and IF they would feel ok. WELL, was I taken back by these!!
First off, the packaging reminds me of Apple the way everything is in small boxes, and that this makes good use of the entire package.
They come with a wide range of different ear tips, so the fit in the ear canal was perfect!
This version, military grade, has a little nublet at the top of the bud, that LOCKS into the outer, inner portion of the ear, AND the buds come with small rubber stabilizing gel fins that make the fit more stable by LOCKING into the ear! Due to this, it seals so much better in the ear. THIS simple act gives these buds spectacular sound quality!!
now for the bad...
apparently, the gel fin stablizer must be removed to charge. therefore i dont think they will last long before they get lost..."
"They're... OK. They get the job done. Kinda weird controls and a little hard to clean. They perform though.
IDK, I miss my Jabra Elites. And I'll never forget my Airpod Pros. These won't be remembered like that, but they run like a Camry. Lol"
"I brought these for a friend for their Birthday and they said that they love them, and the music is really clear. When I am on the phone with my friend and they are using the earbuds, I can hear and understand them really well. Looking to purchase a pair for myself."
These earbuds are game changers! They are customizable to fit your ear. They are as loud as you want and can even be turned on and off with gloves. 10/10 would recommend it to anyone in need of wireless earbuds.
"These headphones have far exceeded my expectations of quality. I came at them with some skepticism being a musician of multiple instruments with 20 years experience. I am glad to say I was wrong with my original assumption. Sound is rich, varying modes are useful, and the fit is exceptional.

I am also an active duty member of the Army and need things to last a while due to field conditions. From what I get so far, these headphones are 100% more durable than my previous AirPods."
Great product
Works as said in ad last long almost never have to charge the case.
"Awesome sound quality, good design, and great materials. I love raycon and will forever be a loyal customer. I am a mechanic and used to go through earbuds quite regularly (I'm pretty hard on them) raycon has always withstood what I throw at them."
This is an upgrade to my husband's 3 yr old Raycons. He uses them everyday and was super impressed by how rugged and secure his new case is. The battery should last him most of the workweek. He loves the sound quality and the ability to toggle between noise canceling and awareness mode. I expect these to last a few more years. Raycon family all the way!
"So, let me start off by saying that I am in one of the actual industries that would make sense for these earbuds: demolition and construction.

All I was looking for was a Bluetooth earbud that had better battery life Per Earbud than my current pair of AirPods. These exceed that request so far.
I typically only wear one earbud at a time, as I still need to be able to hear my coworkers or any potential hazards that may be present. My AirPods had a life of roughly 4-5 hours of playtime depending on volume.
So far, I’ve gotten about 7 hours of playtime with the Raycon’s before needing to swap from the right bud to the left.

I’m personally not worried about the touch controls possibly failing on the left earbud (like other reviewers have mentioned), as I never use that particular feature. However, I still will update my review in a few months, or once a problem arises.

For a few other positives, the fit is great (I didn’t even need to attach any of the fins or other earpieces). I also am glad for the water resistance, as my job can get rather wet occasionally."
"At first charging issues I had yet found the ear inserts I use not from Raycon, make the buds not charge Changed to different lower profile buds and charging now is awesome. The bass is good, the functions are great with easy taps and control.
Sometimes can be Battery life, use them for my main headset for PC and Phone so on a long time, can get the 12 hours on multi-point yet best is 8 as I use them all the time. They charge well I use wireless charging.
Rare occasion I have an issue where they are in the case yet not releasing from the Devices while charging, just once in a while and they do not charge, yet this is minor for the need they perform.

Anyway these are awesome. Daughter now wants a pair ."
The product works as it should but the case for the ear buds is broke it's self and missing the charging slot cover. And it seems to not have noise canceling function and occasionally when an awareness mode it seems to slip out of awareness mode
I don't know why everybody says that Raycon isn't worth the money. Find me any other earbuds that have a battery pack I don't have to charge for over 2 months on end. I had the E55 pros and was disappointed that they discontinued when I lost them. These were a perfect replacement. It took a little while to re-memorize the button taps but once I did the rest of the functionality became smooth.
"I am a sony guy xm3 xm4 earbuds
Now conflicted how good these sounds
Loud sound and even heavier bass if I wanted.
Sony cannot keep up.
So easy to control volume just by swiping left or right in any direction. Sony can't even do swipe.
Can barely feel them in my ears with larger size.they just stay there
Wireless charging and looooooong battery life

Cons
Noise canceling Sony still better,but I don't complain ."
"My second pair of Raycon earbuds and both pairs stopped working within a few months of purchase with the same issue. I had hoped another model would alliviate some of that but alas I was mistaken. These only lasted 6 months for me and the left headphone doesn't work anymore. The other pair lasted 4 months. I tired all the tech support like cleaning the contacts and unpairing etcetera but nothing worked. I think the speaker itself is broken on one and the other won't hold charge. Won't be buying Raycon again. I've found better luck with Soundcore which is another ""more affordable"" brand."
"Still new to the earbud Sean so to me noise cancelation, sound quality and battery life seem to be good I'm sure there are better and worse out there. one thing I do believe would be better is that the way volume is controlled, one tap at a time sometimes I pause it which takes a double tap I have another pair that you hold to raise volume that works better for me but maybe not for others. And not sure about the fit yet as in staying in the ear without falling out mushroom season is here, and this part will get tested soon and I will update if anything negative arises. So, to sum it up so far so good."
Nothing but great things to say about these headphones. They are highly recommended.
"I have no complaints about the rayon impacts.
Read reviews saying they didn’t sound good, I say they sound awesome.
One review stated he couldn’t run on the treadmill because they’d fall out of his ear after a few strides. Either his ears or my ears are abnormal because to me they are very secure.
These are well worth the money to me."
"First impressions were strong -- attractive packaging, incredibly easy to set up (I literally opened the capsule and my phone gave me the option to connect via Bluetooth, done) and fit was near perfect without having to change the tips.

I was then seriously impressed by the sound. I was expecting a significant drop-off in quality from my over-the-ear Bose headphones -- which wasn't going to be a problem, as I got these earbuds for when I am on the move, or taking a video call and want to look more professional, or I am minding my kid and I want to keep an ear out at all times to hear him -- but my expectations were surpassed, big time.

I've never been able to wear in-ear headphones for extended periods of time without my ear aching afterwards, so I am intrigued how these would hold up if I have to wear them for a full work day, but these felt a great fit from the first moment I put them in, I didn't even have to change the tip size (although I appreciate the different sizes that it comes with).

All-in-all, I am delighted with these earbuds!"
My headphones automatically connect to a coworkers phone even though I’m not trying to connect them to their phone. I open the case to connect to my phone and they are automatically playing their music it is extremely frustrating I spent a lot of money on this product. I have factory reset it several times and deleted it off of their phone just to have it automatically connect again even though my phone is closer. I am extremely dissatisfied with the connectivity. Great sound and noise cancellation but seriously need to make it to where I can control what it connects to will not be buying again.
"I bought these and the Jabra Elite 10 at the same time. I do not understand the hype with the Jabra's. They were decent but not earth shattering good. I had some left ear connectivity issues and returned them. These Impact buds, however, at their price point are unmatched in value and performance. At times I prefer them over my Sony WF-1000XM5's. Granted, there's no app to use, everything is done by touching the ear buds but, again, at their current price and considering fit and sound, they are unbeatable. EQ settings are disappointing because there's no app to adjust the settings but I get around this deficiency by using the Wavelet app. I'm tempted to buy a second pair. Oh, multipoint connections, too. Bose doesn't even do that. Even more, an IP67 rating! These are fantastic. Great job, Raycon."
"Okay, So I have tried many earbuds, apple airpod pro, Sony XM5's The first iteration of the raycons before they had any different brands or types of earbuds. And hands down, I mean HANDS DOWN!! The BEST earbuds I have ever owned are these Impact earbuds, WOW the clarity, the bass is so deep, when I tell you the bass is literally headphone quality. Never have I had that out of any ear buds. The battery life is astonishing for having them cranked all the way up. I got 11 hours on full blast. (I work with them in) Anc I can't really tell because the normal seal works naturally well. The only thing I wish these had was a way to ignore touch controls on the buds so I could sleep with them in. They are very comfortable. These could almost replace gaming headphones (Almost) I cannot wait to see the next generation of impact earbuds. I'm sold!"
"I bought them for my son, and they worked great for a few weeks. Just before we went on a trip, one of them stopped working. He did not think anything of it and thought he could fix it himself. He tried all the videos they suggested on Amazon and tried to get hold of the people who made them. We were out of the country and could not send them back in time to get a refund from Amazon to get more. He had looked at and reviewed dozens of noise-canceling air buds and picked these. I have never had any issues with stuff from Amazon until now. At $150.00, it is a lot of money to lose."
No es lo que dice la descripción el producto. Puede ser de buena resistencia a los malos tratos y golpes pero lo más importante para mí es la CANCELACION DE RUIDO que buscaba. No puedo decir que el sonido es magnífico ya que suenan como unos de mucho menos precio. No me gusta la calidad del sonido. Me siento decepcionada. Básicamente por eso los devuelvo.
"For the price you would expect a pair of earbuds that felt sturdier than they do and the earbuds don't really lock into your ears that well, went for a quick jog on my treadmill with them in and they started to fall out almost instantly. But the noise cancellation/quality is decent."
I have put these through a lot and they have worked through it all. Great sound and very durable. Would recommend if you beat up your earbuds. Very waterproof as well. Only issue is they are a bit wonky with charging or with swapping out one earbud when using for phone calls. Very minor issue that I have learned how to fix. Otherwise Great Product.
Left controls didn’t work when they showed up but used them for a few weeks to see if I liked them. Didn’t seem to stay tight in my ear so the sound cancelling wasn’t working as it should. They are comfortable and stayed in my ears just wasn’t a tight fit. They have great sound quality
Great earbuds overall but they somehow managed to make any conceivably intuitive action for changing a song or pausing IMPOSIBLE. instead without an instruction manual the best you can do it change to 1 of 20 different sound settings with no discernable difference.
"If you are a Machinist like I am and your company requires Noise Dampening Ear Buds, THESE quality ear buds qualify. I got them for work, so if your work requests that you have noise Dampening ear buds these are worth the money. They have an EXTREMELY long batter life that can get you through even 12 hour days easily. Even good for a weekend."
This is so amazing I live with headphones in and these are a game changer they sound so good it’s like surround sound in a little and unbreakable earbuds they fit perfectly in like they were never there they come with to chargers when for the new iPhone charger ports and regular they look amazing as well they have a carbon fiber look sleek and very comfortable and untouchable with this I feel like this will last for my whole life time cause how good it is I’ve bought all the ray on earbuds form the everyday to the fitness but by far the impact Raycons are the best life changing I saw cured my depression!
Very good battery life and sound quality
I got my earbuds earlyer this month and I gave the the month to write this and I got to say I only get 2 to 3 hours of battery life nowhere close to 90 hours the only good thing about these is the sound quality it good.
"They are comfortable , sound clear but so do cheaper ones ..wish they had more base"
I bought my son a couple of cheaper ones and just for them to break or just stop working. Just decided to buy these that are more but he loves them and haven't had any issues. Great sound. Also has the transparency feature where you can still hear outside noise while having them on which is a great feature.
100% love these earbuds. Super clear sound lots of bass and they stay charged forever It seems like.
"I love everything about these earbuds. They fit amazingly, they are compact and don't stick out from my ears. They stay in with rigorous movement and activity. The awareness mode really surprised me. I almost don't want to take them out during my day.

Best earbuds for me. Thank you Raycon for these amazing earbuds. I'll be buying a pair for my wife in the near future."
"I purchased these for my husband. He works in construction so needed something durable and that helped him hear in noisy environments. These so incredibly well!! They cancel background noise, are durable, fit his ears well and are lightweight enough to wear for hours at a time. He loves the sound quality! I feel these were an amazing investment!"
The only downside when I use these is sometimes when I’m on a call it echos .
"The Raycon Impact Earbuds are everything I wanted in a pair of wireless earbuds and more! With outstanding sound quality, comfortable fit, long battery life, and intuitive touch controls, they've become an indispensable part of my daily life. The durable build and sweat-resistant design make these earbuds perfect for workouts and outdoor activities. The noise cancelling and various sound modes really allow you to enjoy your music to the fullest. The battery life on this pair of earbuds is outstanding. With 90 hours of battery life, I never have to worry if my earbuds have enough battery to get me through my workout. I would highly recommend these to anyone looking to purchase new earbuds!"
"The left bud doesn't charge consistently and dies a minute after taking it out of the case. Not sure if bud or case is defective. sucks because I love everything else about them, but that's my low vote."
"Worth the money, sturdy, durable works as intended blocks out xtra noise when in use. Husband reports they are comfortable to wear."
"While they are advertised as great for the outdoors, be advised that these are not suitable for active use. Even with the various sizes of ear fitting components, they will fall out if you are biking(even stationary), jogging, or just casually chewing something. I couldn’t get any of the provided fitting pieces to change this. On the plus side, they sound decent and the sound cancelling is nice. They also last a long time with the included charging case. Good for long flights, bus rides, or other sedentary use, but that’s about it."
These earbuds are the best! My husband and son are rough on them and these by far have stood up to everything’s they claim to. Raycon has always been our favorite name brand to go to for earbuds and headphones! My son loves these and says they are the most comfortable ones he has. The quality is outstanding
My favorite earbuds. Ran one bud over with my semi truck and still works great
"I wear my earbud in the gym all the time with my long hair. The problem is that because of that and the fact I sweat alot, my impact raycons kept going off and saying turning off or anc mode on and off over and over again when I wasn't even touching it. Because of the touch sensitivity on the sides of the earbuds it kept doing this. If you use them for other uses go ahead but if your like me who uses them to workout don't buy them and go buy the e55s there better in this regard."
"These are the one of the worst earbuds I’ve ever owned. Left earbud doesn’t charge, they disconnect randomly and the touch buttons don’t work. Sometimes I can’t turn them on or off. The sound quality is terrible. Sounds like somebody put their phone in a bucket to try and make it louder. Sound quality was comparable to the earbuds that airplanes give out for free. The first day, when they actually worked, I tried all three sound settings and they sounded the same. I must have gotten a bad pair or something because there’s no way these are rated this highly at this price point. They are comfortable though so I’ll give it 2 stars."
Good earbuds except the tap controls does not always work and you have to keep tapping for it to work kind of wish you would have just been a push button instead.
This is my third pair of Raycons. First pair got run over by a car. Second ones had for four years. Figured it was time for an upgrade. Use almost daily.
"Ive been using these earbuds for a few months now. They sound great, and the touch functions are mostly easy to use. However the issue comes with charging. 3 or 4 times now ive taken them out of the case only to have them with <10٪ charge.

One problem is that if the case itself is plugged in, the buds themselves wont charge. Which is terrible UX.

Another problem is that, well, they just wont charge sometimes.

I miss wired headphones."
I use these when I’m operating my farm tractor. ANC cancels noise and these last 8 hours without a recharge. Great sound.
"Generally pretty solid, however I'm having a lot of issues with the earbuds not fully charging. It's pretty frustrating. One earbud will charge fully, while the other one will not, and dies fairly quickly. I've tried to make sure I see the green LED flash when I insert them into the case, however that does not always mean the earbud will actually charge. If this continues I might have to return them. For the price I would expect better quality."
These are great. I’ve tried multiple different brands and these by far work the best
"Using the extra small ear tips and the extra small stabalizing fins, and it’s still too big, causing the cartilage in my ear to be sore to the touch. Sound quality is good, just hurts my ears. Oh, also, it’s advertised to have a 12 hour battery, which was the deciding factor to why I got these earbuds, and not something else, because I work 10+ hour shifts. Only seems to last around 6-8 hours if I’m lucky. Would give this a 5 star if it didn’t hurt my ears, and lasted as long as advertised."
"I've had Raycons for the past 2-3 years and use them daily. I ordered a new set of impact earbuds, they wouldn't answer a call, end a call or start/stop music. I was frustrated but figured it was an isolated problem. I gotta a replacement and found that they worked EXACTLY the same!! Which is to say, they don't! Raycon offers ZERO support, imagine that! A tech company that doesn't offer product support? What a joke! Walmart sells $20 earbuds that work better than this $160 junk. Don't waste your money!"
Work great all the way around very impressive
"Still have an issue trying to answer phone from them, other than that they work really well."
"They dont sync after 4 months of use, they will not both operate at the same time the noise canceling glitches and any wind noise blows your eardrums out. Dont waste your money on these earbuds not worth the 70 dollars. Walmarts 20 dollar bluetooth earbuds work better than these."
"Continually disconnecting when I place my phone in my pocket (fully charged) part of the time when I receive calls it activates the buds, but more often then not I have to physically change from phone to earphones, only plus is the treble quality, 10 out of 10 there, great fitment, bass is lacking terribly even with an adjusted equalizer, I will never buy Raycon again going from PowerBeats Pros I was skeptical to switch and with good reason..:/"
I got these earbuds and at first they were really good. But within 2 hours of use the right earbud audio just stopped working. I cleaned the connections and let it charge for a few hours to try again and the right earbud is still not working.
Purchased these for my 16-yr old son. He is very happy with them. Especially like the noise cancelling feature.
"I haven’t had mine for long and I am almost always listening to podcasts or music at work, and the sound quality compared or AirPods is not up to snuff"
"*UPDATE*

I've had these for 4 months and they have stopped charging completely. No mater what I do, I cannot get the case to recharge. Without the case, they are useless, obviously. So disappointing. These were way too pricy for the durability. (I really only use them in an office setting).

I really wanted a truly waterproof headphone. I work outside a LOT. As soon as water hits these, they either change settings, pause your media, or shut themselves down. The rain acts like a ""touch"" from your finger. They come with a rubber piece to make them more fitting, but they won't fit back in the charger case correctly with that piece on. The sound is ok, but a little sharp compared to other buds I've owned.
I had these in my cart for a while, finally bought them thinking I was doing something great for myself, but honestly just feel like I wasted my money. Disappointing."
Fit and finish are fantastic
I LOVE THEM
"Most of the time the left ear bud refuses to pair and eventually just powers off. On the ocasion it decides to pair, within a minute it loses the connection and wont go into pairing mode. These came with this problem. Had them 2 days and cant even use half the product. Useless and way to expensive to not work out of the box."
"Assembly instructions were confusing. I never could determine how the stabilizers were supposed to be installed, or even their purpose
A voice would announce the different sound profiles/settings. I couldn't tell the when noise reduction came on beyond the announcement noise reduction was active. Having used noise reduction ear buds and headphones for decades, I know noise reduction when I hear it; the NR in these bud is impossible to detect.
Don't bother with switching the bass sound or pure sound-no difference."
Raycon earbuds suck they cut out you can't even walk away from your phone without them disconnecting from your phone the battery life is not very good at all only lasted a couple hours and completely had to recharge them again after having a recharge all night would not buy these ever again these headphones suck
Noise cancellation is top tier. Very comfy. Great sound.
"The right earbud went out and stopped working. Raycon stopped responding once I filled out my warranty claim form so I'm S.O.L.. I bought the ""expensive"" ones because they were supposed to be durable but that wasn't the case at all. I wouldn't support the company or this seller since Raycon INC and Raycon don't have anything to do with each other.. apparently."
Easy to pare up. Sounds great
very good earbuds
I bought these things the 20th of June and as of August the 2nd the left earbud stopped working all together.. the first issue was they couldn’t tell they were in the case so they would continue playing audio while in the case.. now the left ear won’t charge at all
"Hubby loves!! He said, these are the best ones he had so far."
"I use these exclusively for white noise while sleeping. Unfortunately, they don't have an app to control the hardware. This means you can't shut off the touch controls, which causes them to randomly change settings or shut off while laying down."
"I would be listening to these cheap ass earbuds, and the right one would lose connectivity all the time. Now they don’t even connect at all Junk"
I thought these would be good since I had the fitness ear buds. But I have been more frustrated by how poorly they work. The 2 things they do better is battery life and sound. What they don't do is stay in your ear and when not in use constantly disconnect from charger and reconnect to your phone or only one will recharge and need to be reset every other day. I have had these for less than a month. My fitness buds work perfectly with no issues what so ever.
Solid so far! & comfortable to wear. Highly recommended!
Sound quality poor 😢 battery charge time does not live up as advertised
Great sound
I've went through 3 different types of raycons. All ending in same story. Left earbud stops working. First it will randomly start sitting off here and there. Then it will stop charging all together. This newer set same thing. Controls didn't work at all on left side. Shut off after the first song I played. Only good thing that came with this was it was only the first day after buying so was able to get refund. Never again will I buy raycons don't care how cool or how they advertise....
I just bought this two months ago and the right ear headset already died. The fit is inconsistent. Sometimes they stay in my ears and other times they fall out with ease.
try to get someone to talk to you Keeps repeating connected disconnected. My apple earbuds work fine
"Earbuds failed to work after 2 weeks. They were never exposed to anything like inclement weather or never dropped or mistreated yet these "" tactical ""earbuds most definitely do not live up to their name. Unless this company gives me a full refund I will be happy however if they try to give me a replacement set I'm not going to be very happy because these earbuds are no good"
"I simply hated this product. It was a waste of money and time. I thought that I would get the perfect noise, cancellation system in my hands, and in my ears, but it looked like an entire ballroom was beside me, while walking down the street. The noise cancellation system does not work very well. Furthermore, it was not comfortable at all. To top it off, I went through a lot of stuff in order to return to sender this lousy product. Zero stars. I truly do not recommend them."
"Earbuds did not work right out of the box. Each earpiece would only pair by itself, the left one didn’t even charge, and they were just a huge letdown. Had them for less than 12 hours before I dropped them off at Kohl’s for a return. I'll stick to their headphones from now on."
"Used these for a total of maybe 40 hrs. Fully charged the right side works fine, the left now only works on super low volume. I have reset them 3 times now, no change. DO NOT BUY!!! support has also been a joke."
"The allowed penetration into the ear canal is limited by the body of the earbud. This makes the fit less secure than the collar-type earbuds, or those similar to Apple Airpod Pro. The sound and function are great, but they keep loosening from my ear."
Ware these at work everyday .. one side at a time while the other charges .. right bud battery life cut in 1/2 with a month of use .. now having them 3 months the right bud won’t charge or work .. never had this issues with raycon before definitely wouldn’t buy them again
Se escuchan bien pero no tengo forma de ajustarlos a mi oreja. Son muy grandes para una oreja normal. Tengo 40 años y mido 1.90 mts
"Son muy cómodos, se ajusta muy bien al oído, tiene un excelente sonido y facil uso y conexión al celular, no trae cable de carga pero al ser tipo C se puede utilizar el del.movil muy buen producto"
Très bon écouteurs bonne qualité de son c est facilement connecté a mon tél Xiaomi contente de mon achat
"私はカナル型が苦手。
特に耳の穴が小さいため、長時間の使用は痛みがでます。

そのためオープンイヤー型かカフス型をいくつも渡り歩いてきましたが…やっと最適なイヤホンに辿り着きました。

⚪︎音質
WEB会議の音声が雑音なくクリアに聞こえます。
充分な性能です。

⚪︎マイク
他の製品だと感度が悪すぎて苦情が来ていましたが、本品はとてもクリアだと好評です。
同僚からは、有線マイクやラップトップのマイクよりクリアだと言われました。

⚪︎着け心地
iPhoneの純正イヤホンは異物感が大きくて苦手かつ長時間は痛みがあります。
しかし本品は2時間つけても全く問題ありません。
オープンなのでムレも無いですし、心地よいです。

この値段でこの性能。
道具としてとても満足が出来ます。
良い品です。"
"Calidad de sonido a muy buen precio, me sorprendió lo bien que suenan y tienen muy buen tacto de lo mejor por el precio que tiene."
"Los compré por qué me gusta la atmósfera de Xiaomi con celular Poco y un smartwatch.

Pero, creo que no son originales, la app de Xiaomi no los detecta, puedo decir que son una buena imitación tienen las mismas funciones que los originales, los compare con los de una reseña y si tienen variantes.

Tienen buen sonido tanto para música como para llamadas, buen micrófono, valen la pena por el costo pero... Le dejo esas estrellas por lo de la app."
Excelente desempenho
Ottimo prodotto
"Suenan bien, la batería dura bastante y no son cansados de usar, la respuesta del sensor es algo lenta, pero se acostumbra uno rápido"
Sonido envolvente y ajuste perfecto en mi caso. La cancelación de ruido es genial para concentrarme. Batería de larga duración.
"音に関しては解像度は少し劣りますがかなり頑張っていると思います。音バランスはグライコで調整すればかなり良くなります。
タッチセンサーは、アプリで設定出来るのは便利ですが、反応が遅いので本当に操作出来ているのかが分かりにくいです。
バッテリーの持ちは、自分の使い方では不満はなく、収納ケースも使いにくいと言ったところもありません。
コスパはかなり良いと思います。"
この価格なら音質は良いと感じます。
Tienen un sonido espectacular pero no se ajustan a mi oreja lo bien que debieran. En general la cancelación del ruido en las llamadas es muy buena
"Good for the price! Sound quality is decent, the case is ok. I did not buy for noise cancelling, but I noticed that it does not have it. I do not know if it is only for Iphones, or the global version, as you can see on my picture that is different from the picture 6 at the Amazon ad. The other problem is that the beep to find the earbuds is only available when its connected. But if you can not find them, they will be disconnected as shown on my second picture. For the price, they are really ok."
"Se oyen bastante bien, son muy lijeros y dura bastante la bateria."
"Acabo de estrenar justo ahora mismo los auriculares, los he usado durante 40 minutos en una llamada telefónica con mi madre. Mi móvil tiene Bluetooth 5.4 como estos auriculares. Se ha reducido la batería un 20% por lo que, haciendo una regla de tres, la duración es de 3 horas y 20 minutos, no de 6 horas como se indica en la descripción del producto.

Además el auricular derecho me pone que está al 80% mientras que el izquierdo al 90% (todo esto se ve bajandote la app de Xiaomi que viene en el QR del manual de instrucciones). Si ya nada más estrenados hay esta desigualdad tan grande, no me quiero imaginar después de 1 mes, 6 mes o 1 año. Por experiencia con auriculares antiguos, que se te quede sin batería un auricular y solo puedas escuchar por el otro es lo más incómodo que del mundo.

Además, la cancelación de ruido solo sirve para sonidos lejanos, pero no significa que los elimine, no. Se escucharán pero bajo. Si pasa un coche al lado tuya se va a escuchar un zumbido al mismo nivel que tu voz, y si pasa una persona a tu lado hablando se la entiende perfectamente en una llamada. Igual ocurre con el resto de ruidos altos.

Eso sí, el micrófono y las llamadas HD hacen que tu voz se entienda perfectamente y la música y los vídeos se escuchan bien. Pero NO uséis en la app las otras opciones de sonido que no sea la estándar porque distorsionan demasiado el sonido y se escucha fatal (esto solo aplica a contenido multimedia).

Por último, NO VIENE CON CABLE USB-C. No tiendo el hype que había por este producto en Internet (ni cómo varios youtubers lo siguen recomendando). Voy a devolveros y pillarme los Kicoeon J59 por el mismo precio de oferta que son mucho mejores por lo que puedo leer.

Xiaomi es una marca de muy mala calidad."
"【価格】
とにかく安い。コーデックがSBCなのでバッテリーは普通に持つし、接続も安定している。

【音質】
クセがなく聞き疲れしにくい音。低音はインナーイヤーの中でも控えめな部類。

【遅延】
300ms程度の遅延がある。ゲーム用途以外では気にならない程度。
コーデックがSBCだからこそ低価格とバッテリー持ちが実現できているので仕方のないところ。SBCにしては優秀。

※Nintendo Switchに接続したい人にはむしろおすすめです。(SwitchはAptXやAACに非対応)"
Fones muito bons qualidade e preço
このコスパでイイネ(o^-')b !
"Pierden constantemente la conexión, se escucha muy bajo y el sonido es muy pobre. Acaban de salir, hablan maravillas y son una basura. Cuidado con el vendedor “Tienda Siglo XXI”, la devolución va a tu cargo y vale tanto como los auriculares."
Pierden la conexión continuamente
"アプリを使ってのペアリング。
使い勝手は問題なし！！
大満足です！"
音質、使用感、値段からするとかなりイケます。わたしのレベルから行くと、高額の商品、買うことない。これで十分満足です。ただ、最高音量がもう少し上げれれば、星５つです。
"最近の機種の中では、ブルーツゥースの接続が難しい部類？かも。
まず一般的ではないのが、アプリをダウンロードしなければならない所。
最近のは適当に電源入れて機種を探してペアリング出来る感じだが、こちらはアプリを起動して、機種を選んで(似たようなのが何個かあり、末尾までちゃんと表示されてないから一瞬迷う)、イヤフォンの蓋を開けて、見えにくいが右にボタンがあるので3秒長押しとあるが出来ない。出来ない理由は、絶縁シートが間に挟まっており、それを取ってからの作業が、必要。音は凄くいいわけではないは普通に聞こえる。一回ペアリングすればすぐに接続できる(当たり前だが)のは良い。"
"デザインと価格が気になって購入。
耳に引っ掛けるような装着感なので、私の場合右耳の形との相性が悪くすぐに取れそうになる、がこればっかりは相性の問題。そういうこともある、ということにご留意。

アプリを入れればイコライザーで音質を調整できるが、音質は全体的に「こんなものかぁ」という感じ。
別に悪いわけでもないけど、いいわけでもない。
デザインがいいので、普段使いであれば十分満足できる商品。"
I think it’s pretty decent for it’s price.
アプリでイコライザー機能が使える。音質を追求しないなら十分使えるレベル。イコライザーで低音を強く出来るが、そこまで良くない。高音は、しっかり出ている。
買って損はないぼどのクオリティです。
"2000円で買えるイヤホンとしては最高です。
音質は普通に良いですが、1万円ぐらいのイヤホンと比べるとさすがに劣ります。
安くて、ほどよくちゃんと聞こえるものを探しているなら間違いない商品です。"
"クリアーでシャキっとした音が好きな人は不満を感じるかも知れません。デフォルトの状態ではかなりこもった音で低音ばかりが強調されます。
自分はどちらかというとソニー製品の様に低音域が強めの音が好きなのですがそれでもちょっと気になりました。音質調整ができるので高音強調にしてみたところまあまあ我慢できる感じになったので、コスパを考えれば良しとします。"
"10年以上、5000円以下のイヤホンヘッドホンばかり使ってきた者です。
今回初めてワイヤレスコードレスのイヤホンを購入しました。
上記通り安物ばかり使ってきたので、音質に関しては全く問題なく使えています。

しかしいくつか不便だった点があり
・ついてくる説明書に1ページだけ日本語記載があります。そこのQRコードを読み取って、専用アプリを入れる必要があります。
・Type-cの差込口があるのですが、充電用のコードは付いてこなかったので別途買う必要があります。
・使用者の耳の形によると思いますが、頻繁に耳から外れるのでシリコンカバーを別途購入したほうが快適に使用できます。
・それでも笑うと耳から取れかけます。

Androidスマートフォン用に購入しました。
ペアリングの方法が分かりにくかったので苦戦しましたが、充電ケース右側にあるボタン(見つけにくい)を数秒間長押しすると接続できます。
すぐ耳から取れてしまうので、100円均一のSeriaでAirPods用シリコンカバーを購入してつけると安定して装着できるのでオススメですが、充電の度にカバーを外さなければいけないので少々手間です。

上記踏まえてもコードレスかつ圧倒的値段の安さですので、音質を重視されない場合は非常にオススメです。"
安くてワイヤレスイヤホン入門用としては最適。
"音質は最低限。
これまで2,000円以下の商品を２つ購入しましたが
どちらもマイクがちゃんと使えずに安物買いの銭失いになってましたが
この商品は流石に世界的メーカー品だけあってちゃんと使えてます。
WEB会議用として購入したので音質の良さには拘ってないので
満足です。"
たまに、音切れするのは残念🥲
安価だったので購入しました。装着感も悪くなく、ノーブランドの安物に手を出すよりいいです。
1年前にBuds3Liteを使用していたので今回価格も安く購入しました。最近低価格中華BTイヤホン5種類をタイムセールの時に購入したが、Bluetooth 接続が途切れたり接続しにくかったり、音量が極端に小さく最大音量にするのに手間が掛かったり、バッテリーが直ぐにダメになったりとサッパリでした。やっぱりメーカー品を購入する方がいいですね。低音も十分です。ただゴムキャップ無しのため外れやすいので運動中に使うのにはどうかと思いました。
"この価格なら十分満足します。
ケースから取り出すと、接続が完了するので面倒くささがありません。
ただ、音量が小さめです。もう少し大きいと良いかと感じます。"
"評価
値段の割に音は良い　好みの問題はあるだろうが私は特に悪いとは思わない　簡易イコライザーの様な物がアプリにある　標準と高音強調に関してはそれほど大きく音質が変わることはなく高音中音共にはっきりと聞こえる
低音強調にするとボーカルが楽器の音に埋もれて聞こえづらくなる様に思う　音が籠もると表現してもいいかもしれない　今までよく聴いていた曲を改めてこの製品で聴いてみたが一部の曲に関してはここでこんな音　もしくは楽器が使われいたのかと気づく部分もある
値段と音質のバランスから言えば決して悪い製品ではないと思う"
"形によるが、耳を圧迫しない軽い感覚で使えるセミインナーイヤー型ワイヤレスイヤホン。
充電ケースの蓋を開けるとペアリングモードになるが、イヤホン本体には絶縁シールが貼られてるので、最初にそれを剥がす必要がある。
充電は勿論USB-Cだが、ケーブルは同封されてないので自分で準備する必要がある。
Redmi Pad pro、google Pixel 6、iPhone 15 Plusで検証した結果。
【Android】
相性はとても良いです。遅延もほとんどなく、そばに置くだけでイヤホンを検知してワンタップでセットアップ完了。すぐに使えて、遅延もほとんどありません。
【iOS】
相性最悪です。イヤホン検知なしは勿論、アプリで接続してもスマホと接続されてない事も多々あり。いちいちBluetoothで検知して接続する必要があり、遅延も多少気になるレベル。
【PC】
Bluetoothで接続する時は、充電ケースの横にあるボタンを数秒押し続けて白LEDが点滅したら、ペアリングモードになります。（2回目以降は、充電ケースの蓋を開けると自動接続）
遅延に関しては、手持ちのBluetoothがVer.4しか無かったのですが、iOSより遅延がありました。

前回のレビューは散々な事を書きましたが、さらに詳細な検証を行った結果。
良いワイヤレスイヤホンだと判断いたしました。"
"音質に関してですが、まんべんなく出力してくれます。
この価格帯にしてはとてもいいと思います。
同価格帯の中華製のよく分からないイヤホンを買うならこれを買うことをお勧めします。

音質を求めるなら他の高価格帯のイヤホンを買うことをお勧めします。"
"Youtubeで紹介されていたので、値段を見て半分衝動買いしました。
初めてのセミインナーで心配でしたが、自分には問題なく頭を上下左右に強く振っても外れることはありませんでしたが、人によっては外れやすい方がいると思いますので、その時はカバー等装着するのがいいと思います。
音質は良い物を使ったことがないのと、ソースによって正確にそれらと比べられませんが、想像していたよりも音が良くいい感じですですが、アプリのイコライザーで低音強化をすると、若干音が籠るのが気になりますので、スマホ側にあるイコライザーで調整した方がいいかもしれません。
その他TWSで切っても切れない遅延は、環境にもよるのでしょうけど、OPPO Reno7 AでYoutubeを聞く限りはこの製品で謳われる90msではなく500ms位に感じます。
電池のもちに関しては、単体使用で朝7:00から使用し午後2:00位の7時間ほど使用出来ました。
この辺りは音量に左右されますので誤差は大きと思います。
総合的には訳の分からないメーカーを買うなら、名の通ってるXiaomiの方が安心だと思います。"
安いわりには音がいい
音質はそこそこいい感じかと思います。しかし説明書に書いてあったアプリのインストールに苦労させられました。インストール途中で何度も止まってしまいます。20回目か30回目位にようやくインストールできましたが、かなり時間がかかりました。
"スッキリした音に豊かな低音　値段からしたら信じられないくらい良いです。イヤホン、ケース共に小さくて最高！
これが良かったので、Redmi Buds 6 Liteも買いましたがこちらは音もスッキリしないし、サイズは大きいし、売りのノイズキャンセリングも大した事ないしで、Redmi Buds 6 activeの方が遥かに気に入ってます。"
"散歩中にユーチューブで講義聞きたかっただけなので音質問題なく最高でした。
接続もすぐできて優秀です。もう一つ買ってもいいかもしれません。"
初めてのワイヤレスイヤホンでしたが、大変満足です。iosとAndroidで、音楽と動画視聴で使用してます。しかし音質にこだわる人は1万円以上は予算みた方がいいです。
"意外と低音効いてます。
個人的にはインイヤーは合わなかったのでこの評価です。"
"アプリで簡単接続、何も問題ありません。
この金額でワイヤレスって凄い時代になったなと思いました。
強いて言うならやや大きめなので、女性は最近出たLiteで替ピースで調整した方が良いです。
軽さも問題ないですし、バッテリー交換したくなるほどの愛着も沸かない微妙な金額。
変な中華製を買うならXiaomiで良いと思います。"
"JPRiDE T335という購入時2880円のイヤホンを二年使用していましたが、ポケットに入れたまま洗濯してしまいましたが普通に聴こえる状態だったのでそのままでいたらたまに音が出なくなったりタッチ操作が出来なくなってきたので買い替えです。
第一印象は低音はよく出ていますがなんか解像度が低いような感じがしました
がよく聴き比べるとそんな事もなく本品の方が自然というか低音はやや大袈裟な感じがしますが、いい意味でT335比較でイヤホンらしくない音でいいかなと思います。
あとタッチ操作の感度は本品のほうがいいです　T335は二年使いましたがタッチ操作の誤操作が多く殆どスマホ側で操作していました。　そしてケースの質感とコンパクトな点も価格の割にいいです。

数日間使用してみましたが、なんてことない場所でもプツプツ音が途切れます・・・
初ワイヤレスイヤホンは訳わからない中華で次に前述のJPRiDEですが本品が一番途切れます。
まとめると音質は大差なし　操作性とペアリングの速さは本品といったところです。
まぁ2,000円弱という価格を考えればよくできていると思います。"
"音にこだわる方には不満な部分もあるかもですが、私には必要十分です。
低音少し弱いかなくらいの感じで、値段的にも納得の一品です。
使いやすさ、特に通話での使用に関しては買ってよかったです。
シャオミ、スマホも使ってみようかなと思い始めてます。
安くても安定の品質に今後も期待しています。"
接続簡単。セミオープンで疲れない。小声での通話もちゃんとできているみたいで優秀と思った
"2000円いかないという価格を鑑みればクオリティはかなり高い。
接続の安定性もよく、音も概ね満足できます。低音よりの音だと感じますが、ボーカルの中音域はかなり弱い。音声効果もいじれるが、基本的に標準での試聴でそのままの本来この姿で出す音で充分ですね。

しかし、音質を求めてこの商品を買うのはなしですよ？
なので評価の仕方でこの星の数が変わってきます。
音質も優先すれば星が下がるのは当然ですが、価格の優位性を要求するのであれば星5でいいんじゃないですかね。

まぁそもそもXiaomi信者の私は脳死でこの商品を買いましたけどね、ピンクで可愛いじゃないですか。購入理由に合理的事由は存在しない。好きなものを好きな時に買う、それが私たち人間が資本主義であるべき姿ではないでしょうか。"
音良い、デザイン良い､バッテリー持ち良い！価格最高！
"YouTubeのレビューなどを拝見して仕事用の端末に接続して電話やWeb会議などに使用できないかと購入しました。
ヘッドホンとしては至って普通の製品です。
価格から考えると良い方の部類に入るのではないかと思います。
ただし、思ったほどマイク性能は良くなかったです。多分マイクのノイキャン性能が良すぎて自分の声が入り辛くなっているのだと思います。これは声の周波数にも左右されると思いますので、マイクに声が通りやすいイケボな方だまた違ったレビューになると思いますので、参考程度として捉えて頂くと良いと思います。"
外部からの音も聞こえやすく、値段的にも満足しております
色が気に入りました。音質もこの価格で良いと思います。ワイヤレスは使いやすいですね
元々持っていたワイヤレスイヤホンの調子が悪くなり購入しました。私は有線イヤホンもよく使うため、価格もあってそこまでこのイヤホンには音質に期待していませんでした。実際に聞いてみて約2000円で聞ける音質ではないなと思いました。高級なものに比べるとさすがに劣るものの、この価格帯にしては素晴らしい音質だと思います。元々フラットなイヤホンを使っていたこともあってか、若干低音が強いように感じました。ただ低音がかなり強めなイヤホンを使っている人には若干低音は物足りないかもしれません。接続も安定していて、見た目もあまり安くは見えなくてかなり良いものだと思います。ノイキャンが着いてないことに妥協できるならかなりオススメのイヤホンです。
"teamsのミーティング用に購入しました。
ケースのカバー部分が透明なので見た目もかっこいいです。イヤホン本体のサイド部分もスケルトンで中の基盤が見えるので好きな人は嬉しいですね！
音質も悪くなく、普段使いにもう一つ欲しいくらいです。"
"安すぎる！
音も悪くなく、良いものだと感じて使ってもらってます！
母曰く、たまに少しグラつくとの事でした。
xiaomiコスパ凄いのでやたら買ってます！"
この値段でこの質なら満足です。
"音に関しては素人ですが、普通に良い音です。
商品写真などで蓋の中にLEDがあるのが見えるのですが、蓋がスケルトンでない黒や白は蓋を開けて充電確認をするのかなと思ったら、こんなとこにLEDがありました。
買うまでわからかった。良かったぁ"
"ノイズキャンセルは　どこ？
意外に使い易い！"
"リモート会議で活用しています。使いやすくて最高です。
音楽を聞いても音質が1万円台の物と変わらないレベルでいい感じです。
購入を迷われている方は、だまされたと思って買ってみて下さい。"
"仕事用のサブイヤホンとして購入しました。
耳栓型が仕事中は嫌なので、オープンイヤーでかなり手頃、かつ名の知れたメーカーということで購入。

音も悪くなく、コスパよいです。
試しに都会の電車でもつけてみましたが、途切れ途切れになるのと、オープンイヤーなのでやはり周りがうるさいと音も聞きづらいですね

室内用のサブ機としてはおすすめです！"
"まずAmazonの製品説明にある「通話ノイズキャンセリング」という機能が一体どんな機能なのか謎ですが、とにかく一般的にノイズキャンセリングと聞いて想像するAir Podsの様ないわゆるANC機能はありません。(商品説明にもANCとは書いていないので嘘ではありませんが）
メーカーの説明にはノイズリダクションとなっていますがこれも謎の機能です。

音質面ではワイヤレスでこの音質ならAmazonで買える5000円前後の製品以上の音は出ていると思います。そもそも1980円のイヤホンがどんな性能なのかを想定して購入するのであれば十分に満足できる製品ではないかと思います。

若い人が初めて買うイヤホンに、又はサブ機として安価な物が欲しい方の選択肢としては十分に良い製品であると思います。
USBケーブルや充電器は付属しませんのでその点は注意が必要です。
(今どきはどちらも持っている人が多いと思うので潔く付属しないのは良い点と思います。）

装着感が低いので外れそうではありますが、私はリモート会議のイヤホンのサブ機としても使えそうなので購入しましたがこの点では不満はありません。"
ウォーキングや普段使いに気兼ねなく使えそうで買ってみました。音楽はちょっと籠りぎみで期待はずれでしたが声は聞きとりやすいです。まあ色はかわいいし圧迫感もなく軽いしタッチ感度もわりと良く外部の音も聞こえるってことで◯
"鉄道沿線や、車の多い道路付近だと音が途切れやすい事とアプリが問題点。

アプリが通常利用を妨げているので、無駄にインストールし続けない方がいい。
ジェスチャーの変更は、変更した後アンインストールしてもそのままなのでそれで問題はないので。"
"遅延は結構有りますね。
高音は多少シャリシャリしますね。
でも安いから良しとしよう。

AirPodsとは明からに外見が異なるので、
見栄張りにはおススメできません。
初期設定時は絶縁シートを外さないと
反応しないのでご注意を。"
"この値段で、このレベルは凄いと思います。
音質は、値段なりだと思いますが、ペアリングの早さ、Bluetoothも途切れにくい、アプリで、
色々設定できる。
コスパ最高だと思います。
オススメしかないでしょう！"
"見た目もシックで、
可能性も抜群。
iPhoneでも、
アプリ経由で色々カスタム。
これは、買ってよかったです。
色は黒なので、黒のシリコンカバーも買いました。"
"コストパフォーマンスは凄く良いものでした。
ただ、所持しているiPhoneには凄く繋がりが悪く使えるものではなかったのでお勧めしません。
シャオミスマホなら確実に繋がりました。

良い点
値段が安い割に音がそこそこいい。
シャオミスマホとの互換性。
色のバリエーション。

うーん。と言う点
iPhoneとの互換性。
耳が痛くなる。
音の分離度が悪い（気にならない人はOK）
中抜けしてるような音にも聞こえる。（厚みが足らない音）

以上の事に気にならない方やアンドロイドスマホや特にシャオミスマホならおすすめしますが、上記にようにiPhoneの互換性は凄く悪いのでおすすめはしません。"
"何万もする物は音が良いでしょうが
落ちやすい事、無くしやすい大きさ
この位のねだんがこなれてて良い
高音質求めなければ1980円！
それでも、それなりの音などこなしてくれる
イヤホン何処おいたかな~忘れも
ペアリング終わっていればアプリから探す機能もついている満足"
デザインもかわいいし普通に聞く分には事欠かないです。度々イヤフォンを落としたりするので高価な品は抵抗があるので個人的には満足です。ただペアリングの際シールを剥がすのがわからなくて中々接続出来なかったので、そこが個人的に−1です。皆さんは直ぐに分かるかもですが
軽くて使いやすく、カラーもよし。重宝すると思います。
他の同価格帯の中華製品を買うならこの商品を買った方が良いと思います。一応専用アプリもありますし。しかし、アプリで変更できるイコライザーはあまり良いものとは思いません。Bluetooth接続もたまに不安定になります。落としても良い消耗品として使うかおもちゃとして買うなら良いとは思いますが普段使いをしたいならもっと上の価格帯の商品を買うことをおすすめします。
"買ってペアリングして即レビューしてるので今後評価が変わるかもしれません。

選んだ理由としてはAmazonの格安ワイヤレスイヤホンはあまり聞き慣れないメーカーや怪しいメーカー等が沢山あり信用に欠ける。かつ今まで愛用していたSOUNDPEATS製品も最近はコスパが良くない。
そこで見かけた最近では何処でも見かけるようなメーカー、シャオミ製ではありませんか。しかもめちゃ安い。買うしかないです。

耳に自信は無いですが音質の話です。
まずファーストインプレッションですがめちゃくちゃ良いです。普通に聴けます。
当方SOUNDPEATS air3を使用していてそれとの比較ですがミドルからハイの音質は少し劣ります。低音は同等です。簡易的なイコライザ設定でも標準が一番聴きやすいと思いました。
近しい音質だと自分の記憶と照らし合わせて何となくappleのEarpodsに近い音質だと思いました。なので全然悪い音質じゃないです。約2000円のクオリティとは思えないです。
以前買ったこれより高いノキアのワイヤレスイヤホンなんてカスでした。

次にフィット感ですが自分の耳では問題ないです。頭を振って落ちるということもないです。
寝ながらイヤホンを耳の下にしても痛くないです。ここはSOUNDPEATS air3と同じです。

ペアリングですが今のところ問題ないです。
説明書には専用アプリをダウンロードしてペアリングしろと書いてますが特に必要なさそうに思います。ただジェスチャーや簡易的なイコライザの設定ができて便利なので結果としてダウンロードはしていいと思います。

後は今のところ感じた悪い点を簡単に羅列します。
・音質はミドルからハイがちょっとスカスカ
・ジェスチャーの長押しだけ操作無しに出来ない。強制で音声アシスタントか写真の撮影(XiaomihyperOS起動している端末のみ)
・ケースにイヤホンを戻す時マグネットが弱いわけじゃないが適当に入れただけじゃ綺麗に戻らない時がある
・充電ケースの裏に諸々仕様と技適の書かれたシールが貼ってあってダサい。剥がせばいいだけかもですが…

総じてですがやはり約2000円のクオリティとは思えません、もう少し高くても納得できる値段です。正直この値段なら上記の悪い点も気にならないです。コスパの良いイヤホンを探して迷っているならこれを買うべきだと思います。

数日使って色々ダメなところが目立ってきたので追記します。
まず音量が小さい。ここは端末側で最大音量など弄ればいいだけかもですが…。
時々異常なほど遅延する時がある。
接続距離が意外と短い。

と、格安イヤホンにありがちな事象の数々なのですが値段相応ということでまだ許せる範囲です。ただ☆4はちょっと評価高くつけすぎたので☆3で値段相応という感じですね。"
テレワーク中のWEB会議を目的に購入しました。会話は一応できますが、音質はやはり値段相応で、特にマイクの性能がいまいちです。相手の声は問題なく聞こえますが、こちらの声の伝わり方が安価なUSBヘッドセットに劣るレベルです。会話ができれば十分という方には良いかもしれませんが、WEB会議を目的とするなら、この製品の購入は避けたほうが良いと思います。
"まだ少しだが、使ってみた結論として、
値段なりだと思う。
特に音については。

円安で、Amazonの売っているこうした商品の値段もどんどん上がっている中、2千円で新商品を出してくれたことはありがたいが、
音は小さいし、いいと言うのは言いすぎだ。

これを
褒めているレビューが、Amazonにも、ウェブサイトにも非常に多いが、何でだろう？
特に音については、「値段相応」（ダイソーの1000円イヤホンより、微妙に良いぐらい）と言うのが妥当で、溢れているレビューは、褒め過ぎだろう。
マーケティング支援なのかな？"
この値段に求めるものは全部入っていて、なおかつ携帯作っている会社だけあって通話音質がとても良い！
"2000円以下で買えるイヤホンとしてはコスパはかなりいいと思います。
ブルーの色もお気に入りですし専用のアプリがあるのもうれしいポイントです。"
再生時間は気になりますが使い勝手はよし
"対応コーデックがSBCのみですが、この価格でこれだけ聴ければ十分ですね。
大事に使うに越したことはないですが、
この価格なら紛失、故障した時も精神的ダメージが少なくて済みます。
ただ、充電用のUSBケーブルは付属していないので
別途適当なUSB Type-Cケーブルを用意する必要があります。"
この性能でこの価格なら何も言う事ありません！
この値段でこの音質は納得ですが、スマホをズボンのポケットに入れて音楽を聴いていると音が頻繁に途切れるし、スローモーションのように音が遅くなることがある。結構不快です。不良品でしょうか？
"値段の割に色々完成度は高いと思います。まず見た目なんですが、イヤホン本体はキレイなブルーで透明な部分から中が透けて見える。ケースも、フタが透明で他のイヤホンとすぐに見分けがつきます。
ペアリングも直ぐに出来たし、専用アプリである程度音を変えれる。
音はバランス良く鳴る感じ。
しかし、この手のインナーイヤー型は耳の穴に合うかどうかでほぼ決まる感じで、私の場合この商品は耳から抜け落ちやすい、奥まで入らないです。
シャオミの商品が好きなので残念。
２枚目の写真はアプリの画面です。"
"コンパクトで悪く無い製品だと思います
カナル型が嫌な人には良い選択だと思います

音質は良いとは言い難いですね
低音が強く箱鳴りしているスピーカーみたいな音です
この価格帯ですので、解像感とかには期待していなかったのですが、とにかくドコドコという音が響いて全てを覆い尽くします
ドンシャリと書いている人も居ますが、シャリがなくてドンだけという感じです
トータルの音質で言えばダイソーの1000円よりは上だけど、500円の有線の方が良いですね
聞けない音では無いですが、かなり音源を選びます
ゲームとか、YouTubeのトーク系の映像を見るなら、使えるかなという感じです"
"TV用に買いました。
音質は軽すぎたり重すぎたりしないので聞き疲れないと感じます。
意外とベース音がしっかりしている印象です。
100円ショップの1000円くらいのワイヤレスイヤホンよりは、値段も倍なのもあってか音のバランスが良いです。
他に1万円くらいのワイヤレスイヤホンを持っているので音楽鑑賞用としてはあまり使わないかもしれませんが、家のTV用として沢山使います。"
"安いけど、音の良さは価格以上だと思います。
そのままBluetoothでペアリングもできますが、アプリを使うと、より細かく調整できるので、スマホやタブレットと組み合わせて使う方が性能を発揮できますね。"
"とにかくこの商品を友人が先に購入し、電話で通話をした時にこの商品を使用していることを伏せて電話してきたのですが、以前より音質が良く、「あれ？音良くなってない？」するとこの商品を使用しているとのことで、以前はアップル製品を使用しているとのことだったので、何世代か前の物とこの商品を比べたら単純にこちらの方が受け手としても数段上でした！使用している本人的にも私個人的にも使用感にも満足しています。
あえてデメリットを言うのであればアンペア数が小さいと言う点位なもので、コスパ最強だと思うし、なんだったら2つ持っても4,000円未満で済むので試す価値がありです！悪い点を見つけるのが難しい位、素晴らしい商品です！Bluetoothイヤホンをお探しで困ってるなら一択かもです！
i phoneとのペアリングも相性いいです！"
"音質重視ではなく雑に使用する目的でダイソーの1100円のTWS購入を考えていたが、
丁度この商品が発売されたので値段は倍近い2000円程するが購入。
購入してまだ1週間程度だが、今のところ買って正解だった。

パッケージの中身は写真の通り本体と紙マニュアルのみ。
※紙マニュアルは日本語説明無し、アプリearbudsでは簡単な日本語説明有り
カラー黒と白はクリアケースではなく、表面はつや消し処理、側面は鏡面仕上げでツルツル。
ケースを開けると、Google Fast Pairが自動起動しワンクリックで初期設定完了。
設定完了後、スマホとの接続は爆速、ケースを開けると一瞬で繋がる感じ。
因みにバッテリーは100%充電状態だった。

嬉しいことに、左右どちらでも片方のみでの稼働が可能! バッテリー状態も左右別々に表示される。
音質は感動もしない普通の音、アプリで調整が可能(自分は高音強化)。
装着感は、簡単に耳から落ちそうではないが激しい運動には向いていなさそう。
また、構造上か音漏れは大きくて、周りに大きな音があると音楽は聞こえなくなる程。
最後に、アプリのXiaomi Earbudsはインストールするべき。

追記: 使用2週間程度で左側が突然反応しなくなり、ケースのボタン長押し初期化も効果無し
返金処理してもらえたが商品としては星★★★に格下げ"
"boseの最新イヤホンもEarFun Air Pro 4も買いました。お値段何分の1のこの製品ですが、「どうしてもノイズキャンセリングが必要という方以外は、このイヤホンでいいのでは？」と思うくらいいいイヤホンです。低音から高音まできちんと聴けて、ネットラジオもYouTubeの音楽も全く問題なく楽しめます。価格が安いので万が一壊れても傷は浅いですよ！※結構重要

装着感も問題なし。ケースの開閉の質感もバッチリ。クリアブルーの色もとても気に入っています。イヤホン本体の質感も安っぽさとは無縁で素晴らしい出来です。イヤホンを使うたくさんの方におすすめできます。"
普段インナータイプ？のイヤホン(こちらもxiaomi製)を使用していますが、このタイプは慣れていないせいかフィット感が悪く耳が痛くなってきます。安いし悪い商品だとは思いませんが個人的には普段使いとして微妙でした。
初めてのワイヤレスイヤホンに最適
"PCでリモート会議する時に使いたくて購入しました

まず2000円以外なのでお試し気分で買えるのがいい
機能的にも普通に使える、相手側に音声がどう聞こえてるのか確認はできてませんが音声を聞く分には全く問題ありません

ケース含めてもコンパクトで持ち歩きにも邪魔しないのが良い

気になってる方はこの値段でワイヤレスイヤホンが買えるのでお試しで買ってみても良いのでは？と思います"
"チューナーレスTV用に購入。
Bluetoothは5.3で2000円以下！
音は頑張ったと記載されてますが、値段よりは良いけどそんなに高音質とは言えません。
ただ、軽くてあらゆるイヤフォーンが耳から落ちる私で初めて耳から落ちなかった！
そこは凄い！"
"先代モデルのRedmi Buds 4 Lite の不満点であった音質が、普通に聞けるレベルになりました。
SBCのみであったりタッチコントロールの初期設定がいまいちなのは変わりありませんが
２千円で普通に毎日使いできる点は素晴らしいと思います。"
"ダイソーや3コインで購入したワイヤレスイヤホンと比較すると、かなり高音質に聞こえます。
マイク性能も良くて通話機能も問題なく使用できます。
ノイズ等も感じられず、アプリではかなり細かくいろいろ設定出来るので、かなり優秀です。

ただ高価格帯のイヤホンをお持ちの方にはお勧めしません。
あくまで2千円前後のイヤホンでトップクラスです。"
Bluetoothスピーカーが期待以上だったので、ダメ元で購入しましたが、こちらも期待以上どころか、最高です。愛用したいと思います。
値段の割に使用感は高級品に負けません。音も私的にはいいと思います。
"やっと出会えました！
耳孔が小さいので、長時間付けれて電話ができるのを探して何個も買い換えて見つけました！！
かかってきた電話も違和感なく話できてリーズナブルなお値段で✩.*˚
ほんと買ってよかったです！"
I had to eq the sound too much to get a good balance because the earphones are too bright
"Los primero que compré hace un par de años eran perfectos, el material era bueno y la calidad de Audio también, los tuve que volver a comprar por que un audífono se me cayo al agua. Debo decir que la calidad de estos últimos que compré se quedan muy por debajo de los anteriores, el material se siente mucho mas barato y el audio también es un poco malo, no los devolví por que se ajustan bien a mi oido y realmente los necesitaba."
Très bien pour le prix !
"O produto chegou 4 dias antes do prazo, ou seja, chegou bem rápido. Alguns pontos relevantes sobre o produto são:
1) o áudio é bom. É claro que não tem a qualidade de um Airpod original ou uma Jbl, mas é aceitável. O som não fica falhando, a não ser que se distancie do aparelho que está conectado (celular, laptop, etc).
2) o encaixe na orelha é ótimo. Veio com várias borrachas para ajustar o tamanho de acordo com a demanda.
3) carrega relativamente rápido. A bateria parece durar um tempo, já que usei por um longo período e não acabou.
4) prático e leve. Pode carregar no bolso da blusa ou da calça, pois a caixinha é pequena
5) veio com carregador, as borrachas e até mesmo um pacotinho de jujubas (?? kkkkkk). Tudo certo com a embalagem, sem estragos

Concluindo, o fone fornece o esperado para o valor e vale a pena. 9/10! 👍"
Werkte goed maar is gemaklijk stuk te gaan
Bu zamanda f/p ürünü ama alırken çok bir şey beklemeyin ses seviyesi ortalama bass seviyesi ortalama altında kargo hızlı idi
مناسبه للعامه
"Good quality,good price"
"Gute Bluetooth-Kopfhörer mit für diese Preisklasse guten Klang. Wir dachten das es eine gute Idee wäre sie mit einem Xiaomi-Smartphone zu nutzen. Leider hat Xiaomi die Bluetooth-Lautstärke so stark gedrosselt, dass gerade mit diesen Smartphones Musik hören zum Verdruss wird. An anderen Geräten gekoppelt bringen sie eine annehmbare Lautstärke. Da die Kopfhörer nichts für die Bluetoothreglementierung können gebe ich trotzdem 5 Sterne."
"Adquirí estos audífonos para probar y debo admitir que han superado mis expectativas.
Al principio, hubo unos detalles que me preocuparon como que solamente se sincronizaba un audífono o que se le acabó la batería a un solo audífono, pero ya tiene tiempo que funcionan muy bien.

Probé los audífonos con un celular barato y la conexión no fue nada buena. Decidí usar mi celular de uso diario y la conexión mejoró, no es perfecta, pero sí permite escuchar la música casi sin interrupciones.
Uso los audífonos cuando camino y/o viajo en el metro y funcionan bastante bien.

Yo creo que por el precio que es sumamente bajo, estos audífonos ofrecen una excelente relación calidad-precio."
Det här är inte samma produkt som jag beställde förut. Ljudet är inte bra
"Hasta ahora los mejores auriculares bluetooth que he comprado. Funcionan muy bien, duran mucho conectados y el sonido es de calidad. Puede que no sean de altísima gama, pero ni falta que hace. Muy recomendables. Además por precio... Genial. Yo los uso para escuchar música y meditaciones, y ver películas o series de prime vídeo y estoy muy contento 😀. Gracias"
"Affordable yet reliable and basic in terms of calls. Good sound for music and decent call quality. All in all , perfect for the price but still a basic one"
"The buds do not come with a charging wire so bought separately, also would not stay connected for long enough and now not charging at all."
Consiglio assolutamente. Prese un paio e durate due anni. Fatte comprare anche ad una collega. Ora riprese perché dopo essere cadute 3 volte non funzionavano piu bene. Prezzo eccezionale. Grandezza giusta. Suono perfetto. Coprono i rumori perfettamente
"السماعات وصلت السماعه الشمال مش شغاله خالص واليمين فقط ال بتشتغل وصوتها واطي
العلبه بدون كتالوج أو غيار لكوتشات السماعه والعلبه بتاعتها رديئة جدااااا واضح انها غير اصليه
عايزه ارجعها واسترد فلوس لكن الموقع في إصلاحات بجد انا مضايقه جدااا ازاى شركه بحجم امازون معروفه عن جوده منتجاتها وتبيع حاجه كده"
The ear buds keep falling out of my ears
"Excelente precio por los audífonos que tienen una gran calidad de sonido. Funcionan a la perfección con iPhone y Siri. Muy ligueros en su estuche y no estorban tanto. Olvide bajarlos en la verificación vehicular y me los robaron. Así que pedí otros idénticos. Si buscas lo básico y funcional sin exceso de parafernalias de sonido como los Apple AirPods, estos son los indicados."
"Ils sont un peu encombrant dans les oreilles, disons qu'ils prennent de la place, ça fait comme deux antennes. La connexion est rapide et efficace, le son tire vers les aigus, ça manque de grave il faudra faire attention aux oreilles sinon elles fonctionnent très bien"
"Für meinen Mann bestellt er findet sie super, klang ist toll"
"Mis antiguos audifonos también eran Xiaomi y me duraron varios años así que le tenía bastante fe a este artículo y por el momento cumple mis expectativas. Se escucha perfectamente, el micrófono también funciona bien. Lo único es que no trae cargador, pero el cargador de mis audifonos pasados le funciono."
"Conveniente e funzionale
Prodotto eccellente"
Comprei pra meu esposo e ele gostou e veio super rápido
"DO NOT BUY
Trash item! Gradually will breakdown. I have had mine for 2 months:

Charing case has already wear down so much its breaking apart by itself

After a month the earbuds dont charge or turn on at all, takes a lot of energy to wiggle the earbuds inside the case just right so they will charge. If they dont make contact with the box they wont turn on either

BIGGEST REGRET BUY EVER, BUY ANY OTHER EARBUDS!!!"
"مستوى الصوت والعزل ممتاز
مستوى المايك والتحدث جيد
يعيبها نوع الشحن ليس Type-C"
"Maalesef ürün bozuk geldi, kendi kendine şarkıyı kapatıyordu ve baslarda cızırdama yapıyordu bu yüzden iade ettim. İade sürecinde herhangi bir sıkıntı olmadı iade teslim edildiği gibi ücreti de iade edildi."
Ses kalitesi rezil bakın kötü demiyorum rezil almayın bugün aldım şu yazdığım saat itibari ile 14:15 30 dakika önce aldım direk iade edicem bişi diyorsam dinleyin yazık günah paranıza biz aldık tecrübe oldu siz almayın.
Son muy pequeñitos y cumplen si función bastante bien para el precio que tienen
es wird leider mit Micro USB geladen und das ist auch alles preis ist top
"Nessun problema, audio buono e comode"
"حسبي الله ونعم الوكيل نصب تم استلام المنتج من غير شاحن
مأخوذ الشاحن من الكرتون"
"Doesn't have a USB-C charging port, but a micro-USB"
Le son n'est pas au top mais bon ça le fait quand même. Par contre ces bugs sont vendus sans câble de charge d'où seulement 4 etoiles.
"Cumplen su función, la relación precio-calidad es buena, se escuchan bien. A mi parecer les falta un poco más de volumen. Se configuran fácilmente y duran suficientes horas 1 sola carga a un volumen del 80% de mi teléfono-tablet. Estuche compacto y en general buenos acabados. Son originales."
Buenazos. Cumplen su cometido. Bajos aceptables. Envío en tiempo. Voy por el modelo más nuevo.
ممتازه جدا وصوتها حلو
Se escucha de maravilla y son muy comodos
"Die Kopfhörer lassen sich nicht laden, somit funktionieren sie auch nicht."
"Article nul car pas de chargeur, donc pas de possibilité de recharge!"
"Valgono quello che costano. Il volume rimane basso, provate su più dispositivi."
Pasdt
"if you haven't seen it before, probably better go try it before using it.

- it is a little quite it does not sound loud even at the highest volume not ideal for outdoor usage

- cheap plastic literally scratched first day because I put it in my pocket

+ it is the cheapest one out there so if you are not looking to pay more for a pair of headphones it is the best option."
"Je l'imaginais avoir un meilleur son.
Point positif ils sont pas encombrent."
"Non avevo grandi aspettative, visto anche la fascia del prezzo, ma il minimo era che l'acustica fosse uguale in entrambe le cuffie. Cosa che invece non era.
L'auricolare sinistro si sentiva troppo: nonostante il volume medio, sembrava che avessi messo il volume al massimo, mente invece nell'auricolare destro si sentiva molto basso e male.
Pessimo prodotto."
"Me volví loco intentando devolver este producto que estaba en garantía, no vuelvo a comprar nada a xiaomi, y menos a través de Amazon. Ya lo siento pero es mi experiencia."
"En general a mi no me gustan los audífonos de chupón, sin embargo fueron un regalo para mi novia y a ella le han encantado, no tienen un sonido o nitidez imponente, sin embargo cumplen su función para escuchar música y su batería es de larga duración."
Product is good for this price range but battery backup is poor.
Auricolari buoni se paragonati in base al loro costo. Audio buono per un ascolto generale discrete per l'ascolto della musica non anno bassi potenti ma la qualità complessiva è accettabile.
Están bien por el precio que he pagado.
"No incluye cargador, la batería dura 3 horas aprox pero por el precio es una compra regular"
İçinden şarj kablosu çıkmadı
"جوده المكالمات سيئه والعزل ردئ لابعد الحدود والمايك ضعيف وعزله الضوضاء زفت
خساره فيها اى فلوس"
He probado de todas las formas posibles y se me caen si estoy en movimiento. Se oye bien con ellos y se puede hablar pero no los veo para escuchar música.
احبابتها
Produit envoyé avec défaut !! Cela n’est pas appréciable . Ce que j’ai apprécié c’est la rapidité du retour et remboursement
İğrenç ötesi hiç ses gelmiyor
sono davvero pratiche e ottime qualità prezzo
"Es un producto bastante funcional y cómodo, de precio se me hace bastante accesible para la calidad que tiene su batería dura bastante y los puedes ocupar para salir a correr o para el gimnasio tienen excelente soporte, fáciles de instalar y excelente sonido."
Özetle müzik iyi . Telefon konusmasi berbat nerdeyse imkansız karşı taraf sizi anlamıyor duymuyor.
"Sencillez, sonido buenisimo, fiabilidad."
Proporzioni qualità prezzo ottima
"En relación al sonido es muy bueno, se conectan muy rápido al teléfono no lastiman y son cómodos de usar por bastante tiempo."
One bud works poorly and generally the distance is low and doesn't work to the TV.
Los compré por el buen precio se segunda mano. Llegaron perfectamente pero el conector de carga es micro usb y es un inconveniente para mi ya que mi cable es tipo C
"Soddisfatto dell' Acquisto, durata buona e si sente bene"
es lo que esperas por ese precio
"Gostei muito do custo benefício, muito bom pelo baixo preço"
Fast and correct
Ótimo produto
"Non le osanno, anzi, ma seguo la strada dell'obbiettività.
Il suono è molto buono per il costo, non suonano come gli auricolari che comprate dai cinesi a 10€!
Qui parliamo di una qualità generale del suono buona. Le voci, la musica, i suoni... tutto si percepisce in maniera similare a come si sente su cuffie da 120€ (che possiedo), non ci sono suoni che fanno storcere il naso, si sente più che bene tutto
I bassi sanno essere piuttosto corposi e si fanno apprezzare.
I medi e i bassi anch'essi sono su un livello buono, non ho rilevato nulla che possa rovinare l'esperienza di ascolto anche per chi vuole sentire bene i propri video, podcast o qualsivoglia tipo di musica.

Se serve si può usare anche 1 solo auricolare per volta, destro o sinistro è indifferente, e rispondere alle telefonate o ascoltare altro.

Entrambi gli auricolari hanno 1 tasto che ha delle funzioni:

1 click: play/pausa
2 click: prossima canzone/video
3 click: google assistant/alexa

Click prolungato su entrambi gli auricolari: modalità bassa latenza per gaming e guardare video senza delay audio-video.

Case auricolari: si ricarica con un cavo micro-usb, quindi il vecchio tipo di cavo ormai usato poco. Cavo non presente in confezione.
Il case puo ricaricare 2-3 volte gli auricolari con oa batteria integrata.

Confenzione: dentro trovate 2 diversi gommini di diverse taglie, 1 gommino già pre applicato sugli auricolari.
Presente manuale delle istruzioni anche in italiano.
Case con all'interno gli auricolari parzialmente carichi

15-20€ - voto: 9/10"
Se oyen muy bien
Bom som
Mi hija muy feliz
Gostei desse
Precio calidad de los mejores y para oreja pequeñas.genial
Ottimo
"Sencillísimo enlazar al movil. Sonido estupendo. Yo solo uso uno porque necesito tener un oído libre y dejo cargando el otro, me dura toda una mañana en funcionamiento, tras siete y ocho horas da un aviso de carga baja y cojo el otro y el usado lo pongo a cargar. Ni siquiera hace falta cargar la base todos los días, la carga la consulto en ajustes del teléfono en las opciones de Bluetooth y solo cargo cuando es necesario."
Es 100x100 original. Lo volveré a comprar
Molto spesso uno dei due auricolari non funziona
la mejor calidad al mejor precio
Por 18€ no puedes encontrar nada mejor. Mi hija está contenta.
"Creo q son los terceros ya q me compro de esta marca y en mi opinión es q pueden ser los mejores hasta ahora en cuanto a, sobre todo, la conectividad ya que los anteriores, llevando el móvil por ejemplo en los bolsillos traseros del pantalón, se iba bastante...

El sonido está bien.. no es para tirar cohetes aunq también es verdad q como suelo usar cuando hace más fresquitos, cascos con gran potencia y de muy buena marca, pues está claro q hay diferencia, pero aún así, están bien!"
buenos y baratos como siempre
hace su trabajo
Buena calidad a buen precio.
"Comprati per soddisfare più una curiosità piuttosto che una reale esigenza, li ho trovati davvero molto funzionali. Si agganciano immediatamente al cellulare ed una volta estratti dalla custodia in meno di un secondo sono già operativi. Il suono è limpido ( forse un pelo troppo) con dei buoni bassi ; si sentono davvero bene. La custodia è molto piccola e sta agevolmente in qualsiasi tasca. La pecca ?? Non si estraggono tanto facilmente dalla custodia !! La colpa non è tanto della calamita che li tiene nella custodia quanto la reale mancanza di appigli materiali per estrarli agevolmente: con una sola mano non si riescono ad estrarre !!! Azzerando pertanto il piacere di... utilizzarli. Peccato però...
Do 4 stelle proprio per questo motivo."
"Estos auriculares tienen una buena relación calidad precio. El sonido es suficiente para escuchar podcast, no es sonido HIFI pero cumplen ampliamente su función. El punto flaco de estos auriculares es su resistencia. Son frágiles y tienden a caerse de las orejas, por lo que si cae al suelo, se rompe la carcasa con suma facilidad. Y hay que fijarla de nuevo con pegamento o cinta adhesiva. No son nada recomendables para utilizarlos durante actividades deportivas que no sean estáticas. Es decir correr, saltar y demás."
"Xiaomi es una buena marca, pero éste será el segundo que tendré que devolver por fallos. No es normal que otro modelo falle en lo mismo que el anterior, el buds 4 lite. No lo entiendo. Probaré otra marca, ya se acabó pedir un Xiaomi."
Se la possibilità di caricarlo fosse con un caricatore universale allora capirai ma dato che è un mini caricatore Adesso io devo uscire andare dai cinesi e prendere un cavo piccolo e spendere altri soldi non mi sembra il massimo dell'appoggio non dico il caricatore in toto ma almeno il filo......
"Mi hija esta encantada con ellos! No se caen de sus orejas, la calidad y el volumen de sonido, según ella son top y la batería le dura un montón! Relación calidad-precio de 10!"
"Si bien estos cascos son muy buenos con respecto a su precio hay algunos fallos que te pueden molestar, el primero es que para encenderlos si o si tienes que ponerlos en su carcasa (no se encienden manualmente y si los dejas sin usar 10 minutos se apagan automáticamente). El segundo es que si agarras una llamada con los cascos puestos al momento de finalizarla el sonido se distorsionara hasta apagarlos y encenderlos de nuevo. Aun así debido a su precio y calidad los recomiendo mucho."
Gran facilidad de uso y conexión pero se caen con mucha frecuencia.
Ofrece una buena calidad de sonido pero no me resultan demasiado estables en mi oreja (vivo con miedo de que se me caigan).
"Son pequeños y discretos, la batería aguanta bastantes horas"
"Dopo tanti prodotti di marca sconosciuta, spendendo davvero tanto perché ne ho acquistati almeno 5 che ricordo, ho deciso di prendere un brand noto ed economico! Mi chiedo perché non l’ho fatto prima. Innanzitutto le orecchie non soffrono improvvisi rumori molesti e finalmente durano! Certo sono spartane, non si sa quando sta x finte la
Ricarica ,ma per 20 euro vanno benissimo e per me , che ha utilizzato per mesi prodotti senza brand, la differenza di un suono decente la noto! Togliere dalla confezione non è velocissimo ma pazienza!
Unica pecca veramente fastidiosa è non aver trovato un cavetto anche di 5 cm per ricaricare!!!
per me che ho un iPhone è stato un problema rimediare abbastanza fastidioso!
Per questo una stella in meno, non ci voleva niente inserirlo!"
Cuffie belle si sentono discretamente ma per il prezzo ci può anche stare anche se sempre su Amazon allo stesso prezzo ci sono cuffie molto superiori
"Funzionano benissimo con il mio iPhone, qualità del suono molto alta anche in chiamata."
"Se oye muy bien y son cómodos y lo que no me ha gustado es que si desactivas el bluetow del móvil después para volver activar los auriculares tienes que meterlo dentro de su cargador y volver a sacarlos para que se active los auriculares,por lo demás todo bien."
"Unos auriculares practicos, comodos y discretos. Los uso para todo, incluido para ir en moto y no molestan nada con el casco, también los conecto al smartTV y perfectos. Tuve unos parecidos pero eran Mi y me dieron muy buen resultado, pero como ya no los encuentro, opté por estos y no me arrepiento."
"Me encantan se escuchan genial, lo volvería a comprar"
Se escuchan excelente! Puedo hacer llamadas en ambiente con mucho ruido y me escuchan excelente! Muy feliz con mis audífonos los recomiendo
Rly good
"I got the previous version redmi buds 3 pro from 2022 september and it was great. Needed to upgrade and have more features, but got a low quality product. I think $80 is too much for the performance."
The sound quality is fantastic. Unfortunately the noise cancellation is a joke :(((
"Really very good, the sound is perfect, its very delicate structure definitely recommended"
"I have been using Xiaomi buds 3 pro for more than 3 years when I sadly dropped the case onto the Elizabeth line. Obviously, as a trusted customer, I immediately thought about ordering the same ones, but sadly they seem to be unavailable, so I opted for the newer model. I am glad I did; it is so much better with a higher definition of sound and quality. I'm really happy with the performance; the batteries are really good as well, and the design and overall aesthetics are so nice and every single little detail just works so well together. When you hold them, you definitely have the feeling you're holding £200 earphones."
"İlk defa mibuds kullanıyorum, ses tonu bası harika, her bir kulaklık 6-8 saat yüksek sesde kullanılır. Normal kullanımda haftada bir şarj etmeniz yeterli. Airbuds dan hiç eksigi yok bence"
素人目線ですが音質も良くノイズキャンセリングも効いていてサイコーです！
"今まで色々試しましたが何もかもが良いです。
airpods proすら使わなくなりました。
ないのはワイヤレス充電くらい。

さすがに1日の8時間程度の仕事中に電池が切れるので、そのローテーション様に別のイヤホンありましたが、これに統一させたいと思ったのでもう一つ購入しました。"
"Very similar to AirPods in the quality and look, but much nicer price. Only downside is the set up takes a little longer and extra app"
"La calid de sonido es muy buena, el diseño y los materiales son excelentes.
Y a un precio muy razonable."
Super produit super basse beaucoup de réglage .
"Ces écouteurs ont une restitution magnifique des basses des aigus et des médiums si vous écoutez de la musique de qualité avec des basses de qualité il donne des basses impressionnante pour des si petits écouteurs j'ai écouté du 20 Hertz ce qui est très bas à l'écoute qualité de son impeccable. Pour appairer plus simplement vous ouvrez la boîte des écouteurs vous faites une recherche avec votre appareil et vous appuyez sur le bouton qui se trouve à côté de la prise USB c et là normalement il n'y a aucun problème il est très rapide à se connecter, réduction de bruit impressionnant vous appuyez sur un écouteur vous entendez un bruit assez sourd et vous n'entendez plus rien autour de vous."
"Ad un prezzo così contenuto, difficile chiedere di meglio.
Pro: app dedicata semplice e intuitiva, buona cancellazione del rumore (non come i top airpods ma funziona), gesti configurabili, buon audio.
Contro: materiale non di ottima fattura (simil plasticone), microfono non perfetto."
"It's quite good for the price
The sound is heavy with bass
But it's absolutely clear
The mics are awesome
Fitting is perfect
But one and most important is that it hurts the ear
Noise cancelation is good."
"Ótimo produto! Até o momento eu tenho 1 mês de uso e está atendendo todos os meus requisitos, me deixando satisfeito com o produto.
O áudio é incrivelmente bom, em todos os aspectos. Além de ser super resistente, pois já tive um certo descuido de deixar cair algumas vezes no chão, mas não ocorreu nenhum problema na case e nem nos fones em si!
O único ponto fraco, é para quem gosta de usar o modo de cancelamento de ruído, pois o deste fone não é tão bom quanto algumas de suas versões anteriores, como por exemplo, o Redmi Buds 3 Pro. Eu já tive um desses, e em comparação com o Redmi Buds 5 Pro, é melhor! (Porém a diferença é pouca)"
Bra produkt
Pour mieux il faut beaucoup plus cher et certains plus cher ne vont pas aussi bien
Bitter then others
"Originales, fáciles de instalar y de configurar, gran calidad en su sonido."
"Kleine Kopfhörer mit starkem Sound und sehr stimmig verarbeitetem Design. Die Stöpsel passen sich dem Ohr gut an, deshalb flexibel einsetzbar."
"أفضل سماعة لتجربة المكالمات
صوتها اوضح من الموبايل حتى
الطرف التاني رح يسمعك مهما كان الدوشة حولك
لكن حسيت البطارية ما تدوم كثير"
İlk gunden bu performans mükemmel parasinin hakkini veren bir ürün ozellikle gürültü önleme özelliğine bayıldım.
"Los compre con cierta duda porque los Tozo por la mitad del precio me parecen con buen sonido, pero estos Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro los superan, teniendo en cuenta que yo los utilizo solo para escuchar musica y de tipo Rock.

Razones por lo cual los recomiendo:
- Sonido muy claro
- Buenos bajos, sin caer en la exageracion de esos que vienen ecualizados para video juegos
- Excelentes agudos
- Puedes conectarlos a varios dispositivos cosa que no he visto en otros que se vendan a este precio, es decir, puedes estar escuchando musica desde la tablet, estar conectado al ordenador viendo youtube y tu eliges que escuchar en que momento determinado, pero si lo tienes conectado al movil y entra una llamada automaticamente le da prioridad a la llamada y el otro dispositivo que este sonando se pausa. Esta es una super ventaja por el precio.
- Tiene varios niveles de cancelacion de ruido y el modo maximo cancelacion es que casi no escuchas nada del entorno si los tienes a buen volumen.
- Una razon de peso para elegirlos es que viene con una aplicacion que la instalas en el movil y puedes configurar lo siguiente: varios tipos de ecualizacion incluyendo una personalizada, programar a tu antojo todos los gestos para controlarlos con tus dedos mientras los usas, niveles de cancelacion de ruido y si los quieres usar con varios dispositivos a la vez.

Punto en contra:
- Se ajustan bien a mis oidos, pero ojo no traen almoadillas adicionales como otros de menor precio, pero en mi caso me funciona por eso no le disminuyo la puntuacion por este detalle"
"Nunca antes había tenido unos auriculares bluetooth y me decanté por estos de Xiaomi, porque para que negarlo lo hacen todo bien.
-Autonomia: pues hago viajes de 1 hora de ida más otra de vuelta, y luego cuando llamo y tal y la batería va muy bien: 54 mAh en cada auricular / 480 mAh en el estuche de carga 10 horas con una sola carga, hasta 38 horas con el estuche de carga (sin NC)
-La cancelación de ruido la verdad que me ha sorprendido, cuando voy en el tren tenía que tener el volumen casi al máximo y con esta función lo llevo por la mitad: Cancelación de ruido activa de hasta 52 dB y frecuencias de hasta 4kHz
Reducción de ruido en llamadas mediante IA y doble micrófono.
También dispone de un modo de transparencia que te amplifica el ruido ambiente o solo voces, IMPRESIONANTE.
-El sonido para mi es muy bueno, y con la cancelación de ruido mejor, pareces que estás sumergido solo la música y tú.
- En Llamadas yo oigo claro y el oyente me dice que no oye nada ambiente solo oye mi voz, así que imagino que tiene buena cancelación en llamadas.
Conclusión: Calidad muy buena en todos los aspectos y precio bastante bueno."
"🎧 Esperienza Sonora Avvincente: Le nuove Xiaomi Redmi Buds 5 Pro sono state una piacevole sorpresa per la qualità del suono che offrono. Grazie al doppio altoparlante dinamico e al suono spaziale immersivo, ho potuto godere di un'esperienza audio coinvolgente, sia che stessi ascoltando musica, guardando film o giocando.

🎨 Design Elegante e Funzionale: Il design semi in-ear con uno stelo allungato non solo è esteticamente gradevole, ma si è dimostrato anche pratico nell'uso quotidiano. I comandi touch integrati nello stelo permettono un facile controllo della riproduzione musicale e delle chiamate, senza dover estrarre il telefono dalla tasca.

🔇 Riduzione Attiva del Rumore (ANC): La funzione di riduzione del rumore delle chiamate, con 3 pickup e IA, insieme alla riduzione attiva del rumore, ha reso le mie chiamate cristalline e prive di disturbi esterni. È stato fantastico poter godere di una comunicazione chiara anche in ambienti rumorosi.

🔋 Autonomia Eccezionale: Con fino a 38 ore di autonomia con la custodia di ricarica, non ho mai dovuto preoccuparmi di rimanere senza batteria durante la giornata. È stato comodo poter utilizzare le cuffie per lunghe sessioni senza doverle ricaricare frequentemente.

📱 Personalizzazione tramite App: L'app Xiaomi Earbuds aggiunge un ulteriore livello di personalizzazione all'esperienza d'uso. Ho apprezzato la possibilità di regolare le impostazioni audio e di accedere a funzionalità aggiuntive direttamente dal mio smartphone.

🌟 Conclusione: Le Xiaomi Redmi Buds 5 Pro si distinguono per il loro suono di qualità, il design elegante e funzionale, la riduzione attiva del rumore e un'eccezionale autonomia della batteria. Consiglio vivamente queste cuffie a chiunque sia alla ricerca di un'esperienza audio premium a un prezzo accessibile."
Top Preisleistung. Seht gut zu Calls und Musik.
"Cumplen, se escuchan muy bien y son cómodos. Muy buena calidad/precio"
Sono fenomenali. Regalate alla mmoglie e ne è entusiasta. Io le trovo qualitativamente superiroi alle mie airpods 2nd gen. Da provare in allenamento
"Bon son , facile à utiliser/régler avec l'application.
Satisfait"
Been using for months works great
"La calidad de sonido es la que se espera, muy buenos y nítidos agudos y potentes bajos y graves bien definidos y sin distorsión. Lo malo es que un producto como este debería de llevar varios tamaños de la goma de encaje al oído y solo trae uno algo imperdonable, cuando cualquier otro de marca desconocida si traen por lo menos dos tipos. Muy buena duración de la batería y magnifica sincronización con los móviles y más opciones en la aplicación para estos Xiaomi Redmi Buds 5 Pro."
"ノイズキャンセリング機能がグッド
マイク感度良い
デザイもおしゃれ
付ごこちもよい
値段から考えてこの機能はめちゃくちゃ良い商品だと思う！！"
Works as expected 👌
"Tienen una calidad bastante buena por el costo yse escuchan bastante bien. Sin duda un producto con las 3B's. Bueno, bonito y barato. Sin duda los volvería a comprar por todo lo que ofrecen de gama media alta a un costo bastante competitivo."
Good sound but noise canceling against wind is not that good as I'm a cyclist.
Galet bra kvalitet och ljud
Diese funktionieren gut und haben einen hervorragenden Klang. MfG Michael.
"3ヶ月ほど使っています。以前はAnker Liberty4を使っていました。ノイキャン性能、音質は価格で引けを取らないほど良いです。操作アプリは評価が低いですが全く悪くないです。
ただ、ノイズキャンセリングの装着検知が非常に悪く、イヤーピースを変えたり、装着検知をオフにしてもすぐにノイキャンがオフになってしまいます。初めからの症状ではあったのですが、イヤーピースを変えれば治るだろうと思っていて後回しにしていました。今更初期不良などで交換はできないと思いますので、ここに報告として書かせていただけました。

参考になれば幸いです。"
"Pregi: Costano pochissimo, offrono un ottimo suono e sono confortevoli da indossare.
Difetti: molto plasticosi al tatto, la cerniera dello sportellino non sembra ""solida"", bisogna fare pratica nell'estrazione e nella rimessa dentro la custodia. L'applicazione di XIAOMI non è molto intuitiva.
Conclusioni: per questo prezzo offre prestazioni simili a modelli più costosi con qualche difettto che però possiamo ignorare con il tempo."
"I've ordered black, but received white. 2nd issue, is Xiaomi earphones app. I had to reset the earphones number of times before it was detected by the app, even though they connected to the phone straight away. And you need to connect to the app to use all the features of the earphones; to access equliser, set up ANC, transparency, sound profile, check the fit and so on. To connect to the app I had to disable LE Audio via Bluetooth settings. Once you turn it on, the app does not detect them and you lose functionality.
Otherwise, they sound amazing for £49. I would say they sound as good, if not better that Cambridge Audio earphones that they replaced. And they cost £160.
It's only the first day, but I've noticed I've gone down to 50% battery life in just over an hour. Shame I had to disable LE Audio as it extends battery life.
They look a bit bulky in my ears, that's why I would prefer them to be black as ordered."
"Os fones chegaram com muita antecedência. O cancelamento de ruído é muito competente, ótima qualidade de áudio e bastante confortável."
العزل ممتاز ومتوافقة مع الايفون بدون اي مشاكل عن طريق برنامج شاومي الرسمي ، السلبية الوحيدة اذا طولت تحس ماهي مريحة على الاذن وودك تشيلها
"Très satisfait,le son est très bon, immersif la durée de la batterie au top."
"Value for money, quality and comfortable"
"No soy conocedor pero el audio que sacan estos audífonos me encantaron, para este rango de precio son increíbles. Llegaron al día siguiente que los pedí"
Don't buy if you are looking for good call quality TWS
Bu fiyata daha iyisi alınabilir bence ses kalitesi beklediğim kadar iyi değil ama kargolama çok iyiydi
"Son cómodos se adaptan perfectamente a la oreja,buen sonido y batería, lo que no me a gustado mucho es la insonorización que en mi opinión es bastante pobre y no es ni de lejos lo que vende en su descripción, pero fuera de eso e de decir que son unos buenos auriculares y que no se puede pedir mas en calidad precio"
"The microphone is not good, not reliable for office work.
I like the small size, but require charging quite often.
The noise cancelation is average. I used it in Airplane and it did a surprising noise cancelation.
They are the first buds that fit in my ears very well."
Tycker att det är ett helt OK ljud och ANC för ett relativt billigt pris. Har inte gjort något test hur länge batteriet håller eller pratat i telefon än. I appen kan man göra flera inställningar. Bäst av allt är att de sitter väldigt bra i öronen och man får inte ont vilket jag får av andra hörlurar som t.ex. Galaxy Buds och Jabra.
"Me parecen unos auriculares decentes para el precio que tienen. Soy usuario de auriculares de diadema típicos y tengo que decir que éstos, aunque van dentro de la oreja, no tienen esa calidad de audio que ofrecen otros auriculares típicos.

Destacaría la autonomía de la batería, la facilidad de conexión por bluetooth con el móvil, la app que usan, y la cancelación de ruido.

Lo malo, sigo diciendo que este tipo de auriculares son muy molestos para llevarlos más de media hora puestos, son pesados, la calidad de audio es muy mejorable, sobre todo en frecuencias bajas. Y tambien la falta de conexión con otros productos xiaomi, en este caso, tengo un TV A Pro de 2024 y no son compatibles, nose si lo serán en un futuro.

Los recomiendo por su precio, ya que no hay otro en el mercado que se le acerquen por esta calidad."
"Qualité matérielle :
La boite et les écouteurs sont de très bonne qualité.

Installation :
Très bien (avec mon xiaomi poco f3).
Les écouteurs ont été reconnus immédiatement, et l'application m'a été proposé automatiquement, ainsi que la compression Ldac.

Qualité du Ldac :
Très bien
Sûr spotify en qualité maximum, la perte de qualité est perceptible, mais légère.

L'autonomie :
Très bonne malgré le ldac.

- La clarté des différents instruments :
Excellente c'est étonnant.
Ils sont tous très bien séparés, comme sur des écouteurs haut de gamme multi voies.

- Les basses :
Très bonne, elles descendent extrêmement bas, et elles sont bien dynamiques.
Par contre la puissance est vraiment faible !
Ou seulement moyenne avec l'égaliseur +6db, et l'isolation active au maximum.

Aigus et médium :
Très bon aussi.
Voix très bien restituées, pareilles pour les sons aigus.

Tenue des écouteurs :
Très bon.

Isolation passive :
Très bonne.

Connexion bluetooth :
Excellent, déconnexion très rare.

Isolation active :
Très bonne, mais imparfaite.
Sûrement pas aussi puissante que le dit le marketing.
-52db ! mdr c'est du foutage de gueule.

Gestes :
Mauvais !
C'est le point faible de ses écouteurs.
C'est imprécis, je dois recommencer souvent.
C'est très lent.
Pas de son de confirmation.
Bref c'est compliqué et pénible à utiliser, ce n'est pas normal.
Les options des gestes de l'appli sont incomplètes.
La qualité des gestes est pas '' pro '' du tout, plutôt '' prototype ''."
The Redmi 5 pro are a great pair of headphones. The only minor problem is that the bass is a bit of.
"Design e Comfort:
Le Redmi Buds 5 Pro presentano un design rinnovato rispetto alla generazione precedente. La custodia è di forma ovale e comoda da maneggiare, con una cerniera del coperchio abbastanza solida con una rifinitura in similpelle.
Gli auricolari sono dotati di uno stelo corto e si posizionano in verticale all’interno della custodia grazie a un magnete che ne assicura la stabilità.

Qualità Audio e Funzionalità:
Sono dotati di un design a doppio driver coassiale: un driver per bassi da 11 mm con diaframma in titanio e un tweeter piezoelettrico in ceramica da 10 mm.
Supportano i protocolli LDAC e Hi-Res Audio Wireless, offrendo un audio di alta qualità.
Grazie alla tecnologia di cancellazione attiva del rumore a 52 dB, la massima capacità di riduzione del rumore è triplicata rispetto ai Redmi Buds 4 Pro anche se devo ammettere che comunque senza musica sentirete un po' l'ambiente esterno .

Problema che ho evidenziato:
Si sente quando non ascoltiamo musica un piccolo fruscio come di vento , non è fastidioso una volta abituati è un compromesso che posso accettare per la qualità che ha in ascolto."
"Très satisfait de la qualité d'écoute de ces écouteurs, je conseille le Xiaomi Redmi Buds 5 pro"
Sie wollten nicht in meinen kleinen Ohren halten. Sonst hätte ich sie behalten. Der Klang ist für die Preisklasse ziemlich gut.
ノイズキャンセリング機能付きです。ほぼほぼですが、確りノイズ抑えてくれてます。
"Fone com bons graves, se encaixa bem nos ouvidos, o cancelamento de ruídos é bom. Podem comprar sem medo."
"Le Xiaomi Redmi Buds 5 Pro sono un'opzione solida nel mercato delle cuffie true wireless, combinando un buon rapporto qualità-prezzo con una serie di caratteristiche avanzate.
Andiamo per punti:

- Design e Comfort

Le Redmi Buds 5 Pro presentano un design abbastanza elegante e in linea con altri svariati modelli presenti sul mercato.
Abbastanza grandi da non passare inosservate.
Questo le rende meno discrete rispetto ad altre cuffie tws.
Tuttavia, si adattano comodamente all'orecchio e sono disponibili in due diverse colorazioni, permettendo agli utenti di scegliere il colore che meglio si adatta al proprio stile personale. Il comfort è notevole anche durante sessioni di ascolto prolungate, grazie alla forma ergonomica che assicura una buona tenuta.

- Qualità del Suono

Le cuffie offrono una qualità audio sorprendentemente buona per la loro fascia di prezzo. Gli alti e i medi sono chiari, mentre i bassi sono sufficientemente profondi, sebbene non estremamente potenti. Queste cuffie sono adatte a una varietà di generi musicali, offrendo un'esperienza d'ascolto piacevole sia per la musica che per i podcast.

- Cancellazione del Rumore e Modalità Ambient

Sono dotate di tecnologia di cancellazione attiva del rumore (ANC), che funziona discretamente bene, rendendole ideali per l'uso in ambienti rumorosi come i mezzi pubblici. La modalità ambient, che permette di percepire i suoni circostanti senza dover togliere le cuffie, è particolarmente utile quando si cammina in strada o si desidera avere una conversazione veloce.

- Connettività e Funzionalità

Le cuffie supportano la connettività Bluetooth 5.2, che dovrebbe garantire una connessione stabile e veloce con i dispositivi. Tuttavia, ho riscontrato che la connessione non è sempre eccellente o stabile, anche quando testate con dispositivi Xiaomi.
Un altro inconveniente è che la musica a volte si mette in pausa da sola, il che può essere frustrante durante l'ascolto. Sopratutto mentre ci si allena.

I controlli touch sono reattivi e consentono di gestire facilmente la riproduzione della musica, le chiamate e l'attivazione dell'ANC. Tuttavia, la sensibilità dei controlli può portare a pause o cambiamenti involontari durante l'uso.

- Durata della Batteria

La durata della batteria è un altro punto forte delle Redmi Buds 5 Pro. Offrono fino a 7 ore di riproduzione con una singola carica, e la custodia di ricarica estende l'autonomia totale a circa 28 ore. La ricarica rapida è un'aggiunta apprezzata, che consente di ottenere fino a un'ora di ascolto con solo pochi minuti di ricarica.

Pro e Contro in sintesi:

Pro
- Buona qualità del suono per la fascia di prezzo
- Cancellazione attiva del rumore efficace
- Ottima durata della batteria con ricarica rapida
- Design confortevole e ergonomico

Contro
- Bassi non estremamente potenti, che potrebbero non soddisfare tutti
- Controlli touch sensibili, che possono essere attivati accidentalmente
- Problemi di connessione, con interruzioni occasionali anche su dispositivi Xiaomi
- Dimensioni grandi, che le rendono meno discrete rispetto ad altri modelli
- Pausa automatica della musica, che si verifica a volte senza motivo apparente

Conclusione

Le Xiaomi Redmi Buds 5 Pro rappresentano un buon equilibrio tra prezzo e prestazioni, con caratteristiche che le rendono ideali per la maggior parte degli utenti. Tuttavia, ci sono alcuni aspetti che potrebbero essere migliorati, come la stabilità della connessione e la dimensione delle cuffie. Nonostante queste limitazioni, offrono una buona qualità del suono e una durata della batteria eccellente, risultando una scelta solida per chi cerca cuffie true wireless affidabili e dal buon rapporto qualità-prezzo."
Really good and comfortable
Great value for the money. The controls however are touch and after a month if usage still cannot get my head around it. But adaptive noise cancellation and the quality of sound for phone calls is very good. I use it sometimes to listen to music but it's not the main usage for it. It's my daily go to for not having to hold the phone all the time.
高いやつに比べるとノイキャンまぁまぁだが、コスパいい
Gürültü azaltma özelliğinin biraz zayıf kaldığını düşünüyorum kulaktan düşme yapıyor ses kalitesi olarak güzel diyebilirim ayarları yapmanız gerekiyor şimdilik işimi görsün derseniz alınabilecek bir ürün
"Son Realmente buenos por el precio al cual los adquirí pero un poco incomodos de usar, de ahí en fuera si puedes gastar un poco mas diría que existen mejores opciones. Por el precio que pagas están excelentes pero si puedes ahorrar o adquirir otros mejor."
"Como siempre una excelente garantía la fecha de llegada con amazon, un gran producto, al ser un producto resiente brinda gran calidad de audio, solo un poco grandez para mi oído a pesar de cambiar las gomas auditivas, pero fuera de eso excelente producto"
安くて多機能でそこそこな性能なんですが、AACでもLDACでも接続が途切れまくって使い物になりませんでした。
الصراحة منتج ممتاز.. جودة وسماعات ذات صوت واضح ونقي .. هذا يدل على المنتج الأصلى...أنا سعيد جدا مع تجربة سماعات ريد مي برو 5
"Redmi Buds 5と比較しているなら　必ず　Proの方を購入した方がいいです。

この価格で　マルチポイント対応　LDAC対応　ノイキャン　カスタムイコライザー装備
ノイズキャンセリングのパーソナライズ機能も装備して　まさにほぼ全部入り
ワイヤレス充電くらいでしょうか、入ってないのは、、、
コスパも音質も重視している方には絶対にお勧めします。"
"Ich habe bislang jede Version der redmi buds gekauft. Jedesmal war ich ein bisschen mehr begeistert.
Sie funktionieren bei mir einwandfrei bei Sport Arbeit und Freizeit.
Haben wieder Mal einen sehr guten Klang.
Der Preis bei der Leistung ist einfach unschlagbar."
"Konstigt att det inte har pratats om dom här lurarna.
Faktum är att du nog inte kan inte hitta bättre hörlurar till detta pris!
Bra ljud på alla sätt, ANC:n är otroligt effektiv (förmodligen bland de bästa som finns),
samtalsljudet perfekt, med senaste uppdateringen kan man nu även ställa sin egen EQ
(utöver de EQ-presets som också finns), laddningen av hörlurarna i etuiet går snabbt.
De sitter bra i öronen.

""Det finns inga genvägar fram till det perfekta ljudet, men dom här hörlurarna...
- Det är ett steg i rätt riktning det!"""
"Vilket ljud!
Så nöjd att jag även fick beställa ett par till dottern."
"Ho usato per anni le AirPods Pro, che ho dovuto sostituire due volte perché dopo un anno circa non funzionavano più bene (rumori metallici). Ho provato queste che costano meno di un terzo e la qualità è superiore, la riduzione del rumore è maggiore. Non so quanto dureranno ma per ora sono super soddisfatta."
"Entre les transports en commun et au bureau, les écouteurs sont l'accessoire que j'utilise le plus dans une journée.

La qualité de son est époustouflante en particulier avec la réduction de bruit activée.
l'autonomie du boitier est très satisfaisante même si je dois la recharger tout les 3 jours (utilisation très intensive pour ma part).

Application facile d'utilisation pour personnaliser le fonctionnement des commandes / du son."
Hızlı kargo ve güzel ses
"Me acabo de llegar y suenan muy bien, actualizaré está opinión en unos 3 meses para contar como va todo"
"I received defective headphones. The sensor on the headphones got stuck. They would switch modes on their own, pause the music, or switch to another track. It was impossible to listen to them. I threw them in the trash. I deeply regret buying them. I didn't expect Xiaomi could allow this to happen."
"Suono davvero buono, app di gestione completa e utilissima, rapporto qualità/prezzo al top."
"الصوت والعزل ١٠/١٠ بس في المكالمات لايعمل في الايفون
سيئ جداً مع الايفون بشكل عام"
Super klang! Funktioniert alles! Benütze mit iPhone
Se escuchan genial
"Me gustó el producto. Buen sonido y micrófonos bien para lllamadas. Podría mejorar la cancelación de ruido, pero en general muy bien."
"É um bom fone de ouvido, se destaca pela longa duração da bateria, cancelamento de ruído.

Porém não possui longo alcance e a conectividade não é das melhores mesmo estando perto quando se conecta dois dispositivos"
"Écouteurs de très très bonne qualité. Aussi efficaces sur ceux de la marque à la pomme pour 3 fois moins chère.
Je recommande"
Muy buenos y recomendables siempre y cuando tengas cuidado ya que se pueden perder a la minima. Los uso para trabajar y la cancelacion de ruido es impersionante y por el precio que tienen valen cada centimo. Lo mejor que se puede modificar los toques del auriclar para que haga lo que tu prefieras. Vengo de los xiaomi redmi buds 4 pro y la diferencia si es algo notable en mejoras pero si no te sobra el dinero y tienes el modelo anterior esperate a que se te rompan o perderlos como me paso a mi (luego los encontre XDD)
Llevo 3-4 meses y la verdad no tengo ningún problema con ellos y su calidad va acordé a su precio.
Vraiment parfait son extraordinaire se connecte directement à mon Téléphone qui est de la même marque je recommande vivement
"top produit juste ce que je voulais
bien meilleur que beaucoup d'autres marques bien plus cheres"
Cumplen perfectamente con la funcionalidad esperada y con la duración de su batería. Muy cómodos y con gran alcance.
"Otroligt bra bas för pengarna.
Bra brusreducering, mycket bra samtalsljud för båda parter."
"謎のアナウンスが入る為返品。

ANCの効きも良く音もそれなりに良かったけど、残念。
サポートが設置されているけど中身は…"
"Mi sono sempre rifiutato di spendere troppi euro per le cuffie, e in considerazione del prezzo ho provato, devo dire che vanno molto bene. Volume giusto, aggancio velocissimo, le persone al tel mi sentono bene."
"Daha önce redmi buds 4 pro kullanıyordum, bozulduğu için bunu aldım. daha iyi şarj ve aktif gürültü engellemeso daha iyi olduğu için bu modeli aldım. gelen ürünü ilk taktigimda gelen sesten replika benzeri gibi olduğunu düşünüyordum fakat alışamadım diye bana öyle geliyor sanıyordum, aktif gürültü engelleme performansı ve pil ömrü gibi özelliklerini bir hafta içerisinde denedim fakat ilk bahsettigim gibi replika türevi gibi bişey olduğunu düşünüyorum. Kulak içi uyum gibi özelliklerine rağmen memnun değilim. Bu amazondan aldığım 2. Kulaklık ve hala tam orijinal kalitesinde ürün teslim alamadım."
المايك واضح
Sound brust so many times and mike not working sometimes
Sehr guter Klang und überraschend gutes ANC. Funktioniert sehr gut und zuverlässig. Lange Akkulaufzeit.
Riktigt trevliga lurar till ett bra pris.
"Ho acquistato questi auricolari per sostituire la versione precedente Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 Pro di cui ho perso la custodia.
Confermo quanto detto da altri, la qualità del suono è sensibilmente migliorata rispetto alla versione 4, anche l'annullamento del rumore/trasperenza è più efficace.
Materiali a mio avvisono sono decisamente buoni, molto buoni se confrontati con altri aricolari di fascia media che ho provato.
Devo ancora testare il microfono in chiamata in zone molto rumorose dove altri che possiedo,tra questi i pessimi Huawei freebuds 4, falliscono miseramente.
Aggiornerò la recensione tra qualche tempo per ora 4 stelle, ottima qualità prezzo, acquisto consigliato."
"Compré este modelo ya que estaba contento con el modelo anterior (Los 4 pro).
De precio, fantástico, muy cómodos, se ajustan bien a mi canal auditivo y jamás por mucho que corra o salte se salen.
El bloqueo de sonido externo me parece muy bueno, salvo en algunos momentos, muy pocos que por algún motivo los auriculares deciden que quieren ponerse en modo transparente. Pero los vuelves a poner modo opaco y listo. No merece perder ni media estrella por esto.

Tanto los auriculares como el estuche cargan muy rápido.
Una pega que he notado es que si sudas mucho, el sudor puede bloquear las dobles o triples pulsaciones ya que el auricular siente que el contacto se mantiene, siendo una pulsación larga. Pero esto es también muy complicado de que suceda.

En fin, he intentado ser muy descriptivo y decir las cosas que creo pueden afectar al funcionamiento de estos auriculares, pero son nimiedades que no merecen que le de una menor nota.

4.9 de 5
Es muy buena compra, ánimo."
After couple months and falls. It still stays good.. the sound quality is good and battery life is definitely amazing
Se ven genial pero no traen el cable de carga.
Great analog of apple. Sounds quality as always Great 👍🏻
Just what I ordered
"Whoever packed this item to be delivered, put in two instruction booklets and no charger for the earbuds. No other charger worked with this product. It had to be returned. Irresponsible packing and shipping."
Excelente
"Los audífonos vienen sin cable para cargarlos, aunque en la publicación dice que si viene incluido. En cuestión de sonido se queda corto en potencia pero demás se escucha bien."
Muy bien
Buen Producto 100 % recomendado
"Buen sonido, calidad y comodidad"
"Buen audifino, calidad de audio muy buena, punto negativo es que no se conecta con la aplicacion de Xiaomi."
"Si quieres para usar de vez en cuando si, esperaba un poco mas pero buenopor algo son esconomicos"
altos auris
Good quality stuff. Bass and vocals everything is great
An incredible durability
"sound fine, work fine, great price"
Excelente
"La primer semana excelente la duración de la batería , pero después ya bajó a la mitad su duración y me cuentan con quien hablo por los audífonos se escucha mucho ruido , creo que recibí por lo que pagué ."
Cómodos y apegados a la descripción
Para eso digan que no traera el cable
Nice earpods for the price.
Audífonos de buena calidad.
Muy mala calidad
"They are very un confortable, Maybe is just on my ears but i buy it for myself now i will need to do another purchase on something else. I wish i can sell it to someone but after a short test the people try them they refuse and dont like it niether.... The battery life is the only + i can give those headphones but i dont use it and i cant really test it niether so. Dont buy it if you dont want to do Double purchase and waste your money."
Lamentablemente no se diferencea la cancelación de ruido y el modo normal.
"Pero se escuchan muy bajito, la verdad.
Pensé tenían mejor sonido"
Running out of charge so fast.
They are defective. After 10 days of use the left one stop working.
"No me agrado que vinieran incompletos,
No traen cable de carga"
"Pensaba que por su precio serian muy ""normales"" pero me lleve una Buena impression, se cargan rapido y le Duran muuucho la bateria encima la cancelacion del ruido de afuera es Hermoso. Me encanta 10/10 recomendado"
Se escucha muy bien
Los mejores ❤️
Boa qualidade preço / qualidade
As mentioned on the product description section that it comes with type C charging cable but I have place the order two times for the same thing I didn’t got the cable inside the box. I don’t what’s going on here.
"Los audífonos tienen buen sonido, no serán los mejores pero por su precio los considero que cumplen la verdad ninguna queja, sus materiales se notan que son económicos no hay mucho que decir. Lo que me sorprendió mucho fue su aislamiento de ruido, a pesar de que no cuentan con un sistema de aislamiento de ruido activo, los audífonos en si solo te aíslan muchísimo asi que por el precio que yo los agarre por 350 pesos, los recomiendo, lo único que no me gustó es su sistema de interacción para cambiar de canción y pausar, creo yo que eso es algo incómodo, al menos para mi pero recomiendo los audífonos"
"Los compré por el hype pero realmente valen toda la pena, audio muy bueno y el Fastpair hacen que prácticamente en cuento abres los audífonos ya están conectados a tu celular"
"No es agradable confiarse en que en la descripción diga que incluye cable USB C y al abrir el producto no esté el cable en la caja, ahora tengo que comparle cable aparte."
"Se escuchan bien, tienen buena calidad, su volumen es bajo. Para mí está bien porque los compré para contestar llamadas al volante.
Se conectan bastante rápido y tiene una pila decente, se me desprenden del oído muy fácil no se si por su diseño o mi oído está mal Jeje.
Es muy justo su precio."
"Great for what I need them for ,you get what you pay for.I would recommend the product."
"When I read the comments, I had doubts to buy it. But it’s worth. It works properly"
"Son buenos, bonitos y baratos"
Funcionan muy bien la calidad de audio es muy buena tiene buenos bajos
"I don't think I've said this about any of my purchases before but it's absolutely horrible quality. The plastic is cheap and WILL get scratched easily (it leaves a mark if you scratch it with your nail btw) and fit is terrible and to top it all off the sound quality is flatter than a math teacher.

Don't know why people are liking this."
"Buena calidad de sonido, cómodos, fácil emparejamiento"
"El envío muy bien, el producto no tanto, son bastantes cómodos, pero el sonido queda mucho a deber. Por el precio mejor recomendaría los Redmi Buds Lite 3, una joya de audífonos, estos Redmi Buds 4 Activate me decepcionaron bastante y eso que los compré con descuento. Solo por la comodidad es que le pongo las 3 estrellas, pero en si si les pondría un 2"
"Un écouteurs ne chargais plus, mais le problème semble réglé. Le contact ne se fait pas toujours comme il faut. Le son est excellent."
La verdad es que son de excelente calidad con relación al costo lo recomiendo bastante
"Tenía 4 años con unos audífonos Xiaomi, y estaba a gusto, pero empezó a necesitar carga cada vez más seguido y decidí comprar estos, misma marca, precio muy accesible, llevo 15 días con ellos y no estoy muy convencido, se oyen bien, pero esperaba que eso hubiera avanzado en 4 años, pidió carga a los 15 días, que me parece poco tiempo y son un poco toscos para meterlos a su cajita, no es muy accesible. Si bien precio, pero esperaba más."
"El tamaño es práctico y se escuchan muy bien, fácil de instalar"
"Tiene muy buen sonido, los bajos son excelentes. Únicamente creo que deberían poder aumentar más el volumen ya que en mi trabajo hay demasiado ruido y con ambos audífonos puestos se escuchan muy bajo los diálogos de las series o las letras de las canciones en comparación con otros audífonos que tuve anteriormente (haylout)."
La calidad de los material. Y la calidad del sonido Muy buenos en lo personal solo le falta un como de más volumen pero muy buenos
Llegó en tiempo y forma :D
"Excelentes audífonos y mejor precio,"
Cumpleañero feliz
Buena compra
"Ya había comprado es modelo en otra plataforma mas baratos y de mejor calidad, los manuelaes venian a color y la textura de la caja era mejor.
No trae el cable de carga.
Son clones.
El material de los audífonos como el color no son tan buenos."
Excelente
"Dura bastante la bateria, son comodos casi no se sienten, el unico detalle es en la conexión a veces no se escucha nada por un segundo e inmediatamente se vuelven a conectar. no ocurre frecuentemente si acaso 2 veces en el mes que llevo de uso."
excelente producto
"Verdaderamente estoy bien con estos audífonos pero algo que si note es que falta mucha potencia al momento de escuchar musica, en cuestión de comodidad es mejorable, se me han caido un par de veces y no se han dañado así que es un punto a favor."
"El sonido es HD y 3D, muy envolvente. Diseño cómodo en la oreja, aunque un poco incómodo al sacarlos y guardarlos, aveces le cuesta emparejar ambos audífonos."
"Ya he comprado audífonos de esta marca y si buscas algo sencillo están bien,se sincronizan fácilmente,funcionan bien en las llamadas, la batería les dura aprox 5 horas, se oyen bien en interiores, en el exterior para mi gusto hace falta un poco de volumen, pero nada que no se pueda manejar. En general me parecen buenos."
Cumple con lo que promete
"Buena calidad para el precio. Y durabilidad, primero se perdieron antes que fallaran."
No se puede subir o bajar el volumen y no incluye cable para cargar los audífonos.
"Me gustó mucho pero no trajo cable para cargar, no es algo que evite que lo cargue ya que cuento con cable para cargarlo, sin embargo a mi no me trajo! Fuera de eso para el costo creo que son excelentes!"
La verdad ame estos audífonos se los recomiendo
"Buen nivel de audio, diseño 50/50."
"Todo bien, ya llevo rato con ellos y no me han fallado"
"Son funcionales, ligeros, cómodos, pero el material no me convence del todo"
"Llegaron a buen tiempo, me gustaron mucho. Buen sonido
Buen uso de batería, lo único que no entiendo porque no llego con el cable tipo c. Fuera de eso bien!"
"Me gustó bastante el producto, antes había tenido otros audífonos que me costaron 500, estos fueron más baratos y siento que el Bluetooth funciona mejor con ellos, tienen un buen diseño, mis únicas quejas son que la duración de la batería es un poco corta, y que después de cierto tiempo de uso te empieza a doler la cabeza, pero supongo que eso último ya es algo que solo me pasa a mí."
"En cuanto a estos audífonos llegaron en dia y medio, están padres y se sienten de calidad, el precio es accesible no puedo quejarme.
Sin embargo, al utilizarlos en llamadas no hay cancelación de ruido externo, su volumen en cuestión de música es bajo a comparación de unos de cable originales. (No digo que este producto no sea original) pero, si le falta potencia. El touch a veces no agarra a la primera, son funcionales para llamadas en casa (sin ruido) y escuchar música para trabajar. Creo que comprare los REDMI BUDS 5, me gustaron más en cuanto a sonido y llamadas."
"Lastima estos me salieron malos, el touch falla y el auricular izq dejo de escucharse por completo
Lastima tenía mucha confianza en la marca"
"La carga dura bastante, el rango de conexión es muy amplio."
"Son muy duraderos. La batería dura bastante tiempo tanto con los audífonos como con el estuche.
Prácticos, pequeños y muy discretos. Solo haría falta una abertura para poder engancharlos de algo y sea más fácil su tramaportación ya que son pequeños y podrían perserse.
Pero ampliamente recomendados."
"Solo si necesitas unos audífonos está bien, si buscas un buen audio recomiendo otros, pero por el precio está bien"
"La verdad no valen la pena, no se escuchan casi el volumen es muy bajo y el sonido no es la gran cosa, solo por que ya no estoy en tiempo si no los regresaba ya que tuve que comprar otros de marca HTC que si son una gran diferencia, pero bueno ya ni modo."
Se distorsiona el sonido a los 2 metros
La verdad dan mucho que pensar la verdad es mejor calidad 1hora perdon y mejor precio
OK
"Llegaron en tiempo y forma, tienen buena calidad, los recomiendo"
"Me gustaron, llegaron rápido y en buen estado"
"Son ligeros, cómodos, quizás les falta un poco más de volumen, pero cumplen mi expectativa"
Quede sorprendido se escuchan super bien y son muy cómodos totalmente recomendados
Well I got them to be honest assuming it will have good sound but to be honest It's very poor and not doing the job sound wise is very bad not gonna lie not for Musicians or good listeners .
"El sonido no es el mejor, pero para escuchar podcasts está bastante bien, en general está aceptable.
El problema viene con la conexión al teléfono, la mitad de las veces que sacas los audífonos de la funda solo prende uno, y la otra mitad no prende ninguno. Además, no he encontrado forma de prender los audífonos una vez que están fuera de la funda, por lo que hay que volver meter los audífonos a la funda y sacarlos hasta que prendan.
Por el precio no esperaba mucho, pero realmente me decepcionaron.
Regresarlos se me hace muy antihigiénico, entonces me quedaré con los audífonos que sirven a veces."
Excelente rendimiento
Muy buenos y baratos
"es gorroso que no se prenden fácilmente, hay que sacarlos ponertelos y a veces encienden otras no y hay que volver a poner en el estuche y volveeer a sacar a ver si ya, el touch no siempre capta los toques y la interferencia es fatal, se corta muy fácilmente
no los recomiendo para nada!!"
"Not worth buying it, music quality is worst, if you’re into music this earbuds will definitely kill your mood"
Cable Missing! And after few days of usage my buds sounds like a hell. Not recommended product.
"tenía unos redmi buds 3 básicos que por accidente descompuse... mi impresión era que comprando la versión 4 mejoraría algo o al menos mantendría la calidad, oh sorpresa son bastante inferiores en calidad de audio. No los recomiendo."
Me fallaron a los 5 meses pero funcionan bien
"Tienen buena calidad de sonido, pero fueron muy incómodos, creí que mis oidos se ajustarían al tamaño del auricular o algo así, pero paso una semana y lo más que duraba sin sentirlos incómoda no era más que 20 min, también la respuesta del touch no fue buena, a veces no respondía."
Buen producto cumple con la funcionalidad .
Muy rapida entrega
Excelente
No se puede cargar en cuanto lo sacas porque no trae cargador!!
Son buena marca y estan muy economicos aguantan muy bien lo unico es que no soportan tanto el sudor :/
"I wanted an upgrade from a pair that I thought were pretty ""high tech"". The Xiaomi Buds are excellent, the sound quality is off the charts, the noise cancellation is something that I didn't even know existed. My favorite is the find feature, my old earbuds I lost all the time within my own bed. Now I can push a button and locate them immediately."
"Los he usado continuamente, funcionan apropiadamente. La duración de la batería de cada auricular está por debajo de lo indicado o especificado....no dura lo que dicen en la página de internet."
"Buenos audífonos por el precio, la cancelación de ruido y el sonido están bien.
Recomendables sobre todo si usas android ya que la aplicación no esta disponible en apple y no podrás sacarle todo el potencial"
Rápido
it was a Xmas gift for my best friend. I bought the pro 3 version loved it. Especially the dual connectivity feature. I feel this product has great value! My friend is also very happy about it.
More comfortable and has better sound quality compared to the Redmi bud pro 3!
I'm extremely satisfied with this product. The sound quality is pretty amazing. The ANC on this product is really great for this price point and suitably competes with the ANC of more expensive products.
Purchased Nov 2022. It's July 2024 now and one of the earbuds stopped working a couple months ago. Conveniently broke just after the 1 year warranty
"I bought these earbuds in February, and they were really good until July. The right earbuds started to get lower volume than the left side one. Then, the noise reduction ended; one day, they decided not to isolate my ears from the noise, and I had to turn the volume to the max level. I thought I was going deaf. Someone else tried, and it was the same for him. I tried to fix it through Amazon, but they said I had to talk with Xioami and did not give any solution. Don't BUY these! They are really bad!
I used another Xioami earbuds previously and never had any problems."
"Al principio todo muy bien, pero a los 5-6 meses uno de los auriculares comenzó a fallar. Finalmente el sonido bajó tanto que tuve que comprar otros auriculares, desde luego de otra marca."
"Desde la caja te da la impresión de que son audífonos mucho mas caros. Diseño elegante, super bien construido y se siente muy bien al tacto. El sonido y batería es idéntico (hasta un poco mejor) que los buds plus de samsung. Pero estos ganan por la cancelación de ruido y comodidad al llevarlos.
Definitivamente lo mejor que existe por este precio.
ACTUALIZACION: De un momento a otro el ANC se ""debilito"" o dejo de ser tan intenso como era, a penas y de nota con la brisa pero nada mas. (al inicio era muy agresivo y cancelaba casi todos los ruidos).
Quiero creer que les metieron ese nerfeo vía software porque no se me han caído o mojado, o quizás mi unidad vino con defecto"
Xiaomi should update the firmware to resolve connection problems the sound is great.
Connectivity is spotty. Lack of controls. The sound is fine but nothing to go crazy about.
"se escuchaba muy bajo y con el tiempo comenzo a escucharse mas bajo, no los recomiendo"
""
10/10
"The sound quality is bad. They are supposed to have noise cancelation but doesn't seem to work. Battery life per charge is less than 2hrs, standby alright."
"no tiene mucho volumen y ni bass, y se desconectada veces cuando estoy escuchado musica"
"I'm a big fan of everything made by Xiaomi, Redmi and I've been using it for a long time. These headphones are the worst thing I've ever bought. First and foremost, the sound is too weak, the headphones turn off by themselves when you move your head just a little, suddenly for no reason one of the headphones works weaker than the other, sometimes when you change the song, they stop working..."
"Doesn't have volume controls, can't skip forward and back, phone Bluetooth didn't auto connect.

After reading all the stellar reviews, I expected to be impressed- not! Looking for higher quality sound and comfort than the $20 jlab Go Air Pop buds I bought as a quick fill-in.

These are marginally more comfortable. The sound is comparable but the Jlab have more features. Redmi really needs to step up their game. The manual is in 189 languages but doesn't even talk about charging...?

I got mine new on another site (the Jlabs were Amazon) and I'm glad I got a screaming deal. These will likely be used only at home since they lack features for road warriors.

I'd pass on these."
"Producto con fallas, y la devolucion no siempre conviene"

llego a tiempo
Excelente producto
"excelente para escuchar musica, comodos y ergonomicos"
"Buen producto, original y buen precio"
"Long duration battery, amazing sound quality and durable."
"Great value for money. The double pairing works fantastic with my PC and iPhone .

You can still adjust any settings on the phone app while you are using the headphones with the PC."
"worth the money you pay, quick and easy connection to iPhone."
Produit résistant aux chocs et bon son
"Excellent and very good for the price
The best noise cancelation from mi"
Franchement top pour le prix et la qualité excellente : pas besoin de se ruiner :)
I am satisfied with the features and specifications. These are just bit low in bass but do a good job. Noise cancellation and Mics are good. Never had any issues with calling.
Son muy buenos para el precio que tienen y dura mucho la batería los recomiendo la verdad tienen buena calidad de sonido solo le faltaría una mejor cancelación de ruido pero por todo lo demás está exelente.
"Music wise it is nice, however sometimes the earbuds would fade out on me sometimes when I put volume at a high."
"I had an amazing experience with these wireless earbuds. One of the standout features is that when you pull one earbud out, the music automatically pauses, and when you put it back in, it resumes. This is perfect for when someone asks you something mid-song—you can quickly respond and then get right back to your vibe.

The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is also excellent. I used it on a plane, and it reduced the noise of the engines by about 90%, making them barely noticeable. Air fans completely disappeared. However, ANC also lowers the volume of everything around you, so when someone speaks to you, it's harder to hear them clearly, which often led me to remove the earbuds to understand them better.

The Transparency mode wasn’t as impressive. It amplifies voices, but it doesn’t always focus on the person you want to hear, which can be frustrating.

Overall, I’m happy with my purchase and the performance of these earbuds!"
Super Ware. Sehr zu empfehlen.
"✅👏 Enhorabuena para Xiaomi, son una muy buena compra. ¿Por qué? Pues voy a hablar de muchos puntos a favor de esta compra y del producto. 1. Calidad de sonido: excelentes bajos y agudos sin saturar.
2. Cancelación de ruido: Cancela hasta 43dB, lo he probado y funciona bastante bien para el transporte en coche o en autobús. 3. Códecs de Bluetooth: SBC (incluido en muchos auriculares y una calidad aceptable), AAC (calidad buena y buena estabilidad), y LDAC que es un codec desarrollado por Sony que tiene soporte para audio sin pérdida. 4. Comodidad: Dispones de un montón de tallas de almohadillas, eliges la que más cómoda te venga, yo personalmente uso la que viene, que creo que es la M. 5. Volumen: No son los que más alto se escuchan pero al menos mantienen una buena calidad en un volumen bastante elevado. 6. Color: el color negro es muy elegante. 7 Acabado mate: al tener un acabado mate en el estuche, no se quedan marcadas las huellas como en mis anteriores Redmi Buds 3 (misma marca, modelo anterior). En fin, un producto excelente!"
Music 🎶 Calling Best 👌👌👌🤗🤗🤗

"The headphones are very good, better than I expected"
"EDITADO:

(Tengo que añadir ademas de mi opinion, su tremenda resistencia, hoy sin querer los meti dentro de una chaqueta en la lavadora y siguen funcionando por suerte.)
Los mejores en calidad precio. Perfecto el sonido sin pecar demasiado de grave, aun asi si te gustan los graves tambien que sepas que son perfectos y tienen un modo para mejorarlo y matizarlo, si vas mas a los agudos o medios esta el modo equilibrado o el modo mejorar voz o agudos. Un ANC que no es perfecto pero por su precio estupendo, pensando que cuando pagas por unos buds con ANC sobre todo pagas por esta tecnologia que es bastante cara de desarrollar los redmi buds pro 4 te estan dando una calidad de anulacion de ruido (ANC) que se sale de lo que cuestan. Hay auriculares mas caros que no pueden siquiera competir con ella. Es capaz de anular un aproximadamente 70% del ruido en el transporte publico sin musica puesta solo con el modo de anulacion de ruido puesto sin mas pero si ya reproducimos musica a volumen 75% por ejemplo y anulacion de ruido puesta, nos enfocaremos solo en la cancion o contenido que estemos escuchando y no en el exterior en absoluto.

Sensor de proximidad: si te quitas un bud el modo de los buds se establecera en modo transparencia dando a entender que quieres escuchar a la persona o lo que suene de este modo solo te quitas un casco y dejandote el otro el otro sonara el exterior. cosa que esta genial. Tambien si te quitas un bud del oido o los dos se pausara el contenido que estes escuchando y volvera a sonar cuando te los vuelvas a poner. (es configurable todo esto)
El modo claridad de voz para no quitarte los cascos y escuchar a la gente cuando te habla tambien esta super bien ya que incluso a veces puedes centrarte mas en una conversacion cuando hay mucho ruido los buds son capaces de anular ese ruido y pillar solo la voz del que te habla (en persona me refiero) increible esa funcion.

Codec LDAC solo aprovechable evidentemente si lo activas desde las funciones de desarrollador de android y lo activas (sino sigues con un audio hi-res pero escalado y no nativo) . Esto quiere decir que activando el LDAC puedes escuchar en servicios de streaming de calidad .FLAC en vez de .MP3 los audios en MASTER grabados directamente de un estudio a tu oido con una calidad comprimida de un 10% compresion- 90% calidad perfecta de sonido. en vez de MP3 lo cual seria una calidad de un 40% sonido - 60% compresion (para los que utilizan spotify o canciones en archivo .mp3 descargadas) por ejemplo TIDAL te va perfecta si quieres escuchar con calidad impoluta las canciones. Y asi aprovechas el hiRES de estos buds.
Autonomia , dias sin tenerlos que cargar , escuchando musica como 5 horas al dia mas o menos. El estuche los carga en 10 minutos casi a tope y sin exagerar
pruebas: 20% -> 90% en 6minutos, 5% -> 100% 11 Minutos

Microfono integrado: calidad enfocada al habla, supresion de ruido exterior casi perfecta, el microfono es capaz de detectar tu voz pero no detectara otras voces a mas de 1 metro de ti, no detectara rafagas de viento pero si puede detectar bocinas de coches o golpes fuertes. Tipico con cualquier microfono claramente, pero su supresion de ruido externa en el microfono es genial.

En definitiva que por este precio estan dando muchisimo, son perfectos yo los compre como a 80€ y no me arrepiento de nada."
"Har bara testat snabbt än så länge, men jag blev otroligt imponerad av leveransen. Jag beställde kl 2030 igår, de fanns hos ombud(!) kl 0930 att hämta. Så skall det vara!

Återkommer med en recension av produkten..."
"Je suis totalement satisfait de ces écouteurs, je possédais d'autres écouteurs de la marque, et une nouvelle fois, je ne suis absolument pas décu. La réduction de bruit est très appréciable et le son de bonne qualité a mon gout.
L'application est très pratique , permet d'équilibrer le son des ecouteurs, d'activer desactiver la reduction de bruit, et assigner les fonctions tactile.
L'intégration est tres bien faites, du moins sur les smartphones Xiaomi, fenetre popup qui s'affiche lors de l'ouverture du boitier pour afficher le niveau de batterie et egalement indique dans la barre de notification.
Enfin, très appreciable, le fait de pouvoir connecter 2appareils en meme temps et que ca switch automatiquement de l'un a l'autre !"
I have not used the product yet but they look smart and were easy to set up
"Ho recentemente acquistato gli Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 Pro e sono rimasto molto soddisfatto del prodotto. Si tratta di auricolari Bluetooth di alta qualità, dotati di tecnologia Bluetooth 5.3 per una connessione stabile e senza interruzioni.

Gli auricolari hanno una forma ergonomica che si adatta perfettamente alle orecchie e offrono una vestibilità sicura. Sono anche leggeri e confortevoli, quindi possono essere indossati per lunghi periodi di tempo senza fastidio.

Il suono degli auricolari è molto buono, con una risposta in frequenza ampia e una riproduzione accurata dei dettagli. La cancellazione del rumore attiva (ANC) aiuta a ridurre il rumore di fondo, permettendo di concentrarsi sulla musica o sulla chiamata.

Gli auricolari hanno una durata della batteria di 36 ore con la custodia di ricarica e possono essere ricaricati senza fili utilizzando una base di ricarica wireless. La custodia di ricarica è anche molto pratica e facile da portare in giro.

In generale, gli Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 Pro sono un ottimo paio di auricolari Bluetooth di alta qualità. Hanno una forma ergonomica e confortevole, un suono di alta qualità e la cancellazione del rumore attiva (ANC) aiuta a ridurre il rumore di fondo. La durata della batteria di 36 ore è molto buona e la ricarica senza fili è un vantaggio aggiuntivo. Consiglio vivamente questi auricolari a chiunque cerca una soluzione di ascolto affidabile e di alta qualità."
"Son muy buenos la vdd, lo malo es que en mi celular al tener LDAC activado se pierde la musica, es como que de repente estas escuchando tu musica y se deja de escuchar por un segundo y luego vuelve. Hay formas de solucionarlo pero en mi celular no me han funcionado. Lo bueno es que se puede desactivar el LDAC y esto desaparece.

La bateria les dura muchisimo. la calidad del sonido es muy buena aunque no es la mejor, y el volumen de la musica es muy bueno, aunque a veces he querido que tuvieran un poco mas de volumen.

Si buscas audifonos esteticos, con buena bateria, inalambricos, baratos, y de buena calidad, estos son muy buena opcion"
Very nice alternative to the Apple ones. High sound quality with a good price
"sound quality is impressive and its built to last.
bluetooth connects instantly after taking the buds out to iphone. you connect to 2 devices at once.
Anc is very good"
"Für die 50, Euro sind die Kopfhörer ok, wenn man günstige Bluetooth Kopfhörer sucht, die morgen nicht aufgeben sollen. Für Musik Erlebnis und/ oder für ANC - es ist keine gute Wahl. Passform ist gut, jedoch ein bisschen klobig. (Wenn man mit lg dt90q, oneplus buds pro 2 oder airpods pro vergleicht)."
Excellent product good battery life and sound quality
"ممتازة جدا
خامة نظيفة جدا جدا
تقفيل ممتاز جدا جدا
السماعة صوتها عالي ونقي
البيز مش اقوي حاجة ولكنها بالسعر ده فعلا تستحق كل مليم ..
هل انصح بشراءها ؟!
طبعاااااااا توكل علي الله ولكن اشتريها من البائع امازون"
"works like magic
clear voice when using in a call
good while listening to music
all is good and working"
"They were very good and had everything you would want, but they wasn’t comfortable in my ears, it felt like they were gonna fall out. They just didn’t fit, and yes I tried changing the silicone sizes.
Otherwise they are all you can ask for."
"初めてワイヤレスイヤホンを購入しました
正直音質などは期待していませんでしたが、想像以上に良い音質でした。
何よりノイズキャンセリング機能が素晴らしい！"
"Inizialmente volevo acquistare le Redmi Buds 3 Pro per via del prezzo inferiore e della ricarica wireless, assente su questo modello.
Se ve lo steste chiedendo le ho provate con uno Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G NE.
Avevo delle cuffiette con Noise Cancelling, comprate 2 anni fa ad una trentina di euro in meno di queste Redmi Buds 4 Pro (82€) con cui voglio fare un confronto e che chiamerò ""vecchie cuffie"".
Mi aspettavo, visto il prezzo e gli anni di avanzamento tecnologico, uno stravolgimento che dal mio punto di vista non ho notato.
Il volume è leggermente più basso rispetto alle altre che avevo, sono meno perfomanti in termini di decibel anche se non ho avuto modo di misurare i dB, ma ho visto da altri recensori che anche loro notavano un volume non al top, alte il giusto, ma non troppo.
Volume a parte, la qualità del suono è ottima.
La qualità del microfono come le vecchie cuffie sembrerebbe la medesima, per fare un vocale o una chiamata vi consiglio di utilizzare il microfono del telefono, si fa sentire il suono della voce, ma nulla di eccezionale, se al microfono del telefono dovessi dare un 7 alle Redmi Buds 4 Pro dò un 6.
Aspetti positivi che sulle altre cuffie mancavano, la bassa latenza (dichiarata di 59ms) provata con applicazioni test, film e videogiochi.
Noise Cancelling: la differenza non è marcata con le vecchie cuffie che cancellavano 35 dB contro i 43 dB di queste nuove, un tantino superiori queste come da specifiche, ma solo se impostata su ""Profonda"", ho sentito cuffie fare di meglio, ma queste non sono per nulla male.
Bluetooth 5.3 si fa sentire sia per quanto riguarda la batteria che raggiunge il doppio dell'autonomia rispetto alle vecchie cuffie che duravano all'incirca 3/4 ore con NC attivo, sia per latenza, qualità del suono ed in generale per una marcia in più.
Ha delle chicche che ti modificano il suono, ma non sono così stravolgenti, come la modalità immersiva dove uno dalla nomenclatura si aspetterebbe il miracolo.
Utile poterle collegare a più dispositivi Bluetooth contemporaneamente, per farvi un esempio: collegandole al pc e allo smartphone, guardando un video sul pc se si avvia un audio da ascoltare sul proprio smartphone le cuffie danno un input che stoppano il video sul pc facendovi ascoltare in cuffia l'audio del telefono, successivamente facendo ripartire il video sul pc l'audio ripassa al video che stavate guardando (in automatico).
La modalità Trasparenza vi amplifica i suoni esterni, se le togliete dall'orecchio vi stoppa la traccia audio o il video e rindossandole avviano l'audio (tutte funzionalità presenti sulle vecchie cuffie).
Gesti modificabili dall'applicazione, come tutte le altre funzionalità delle cuffie, con la possibilità anche di poter inserire il controllo del volume (le nuove funzionalità non presenti sulle vecchie cuffie).
""Trova i tuoi auricolari"" l'ho trovata inutile dato che il suono emesso dalle cuffie come potete ben immaginare è impercettibile, se non vi trovate ad almeno 10 metri dalle cuffie ed in una stanza silenziosa non riuscirete a sentirle.
Conclusioni: migliori di cuffie di 2 anni fa; ma devo dire con rammarico che quelle vecchie cuffie mi sembravano il futuro (forse per il NC provato per la prima volta, chissà), ci sono state delle migliorie su queste e delle chicche aggiuntive, ma non trovo una rivoluzione tecnologica.
Avrei dato 5 stelle, ma mi sento di darne 4 perché non ho trovato quel qualcosa che mi faccia dire: questa è LA CUFFIA qualità/prezzo da acquistare.
Probabilmente avrei scelto le Buds 3 Pro se le avessi provate entrambe, avevo preso queste sperando in un microfono migliore sapendo la pecca che hanno le cuffiette bluetooth in generale, ma ovviamente queste dovrebbero essere migliori del modello precedente, le tengo sperando in un aggiornamento (si aggiornano attraverso l'applicazione) e spero che migliorino l'unica cosa da migliorare per completare il quadro, ovvero il volume, almeno un po' (sperando sia una limitazione software).
Allegato un video dell'applicazione Xiaomi Earbuds con tutte le varie funzionalità delle cuffie e dei piccoli sketch delle cuffie e accessori presenti nella scatola."
"Qualité sonore correcte.
Anti bruit entre 30 et 3000Hz efficace, confort assuré, quelque petits probablemes de synchronisation entre les écouteurs à certains moments lorsque l'ont arrête et reprends l'audio de manière saccadée.
(Je l'ai personnellement, uniquement, utilisé avec un appareil Xiaomi 13T Pro, les problèmes ne surviennent peut être qu'avec mon appareil, soit suite à une mauvais manipulation ou suite à un problème d'un des produits, ne prennez pas à la lettre tout ce qui est écrit ici, ce n'est que mon avis personnel suit à un essais)"
Alles in Ordnung
سماعة بريميوم فعلا وتقفيلها وخامتها حلوة وصوتها كويس جدا ونقى والبيز والتريبل حلو والعزل مقبول والبطارية حلوة بس صوتها مش اعلى حاجة مع العلم انا بحب الصوت العالى فهى هتبقى مقبولة جدا لاى حد تانى

"Perfecte oortjes maar na 1,5 jaar werkt mijn rechter oortje een stuk minder. Het volume is aanzienlijk zachter als mijn linker oortje.

Wat kan Amazon hier nog aan doen?"
Sound was nice fit was ok.
"El 18 de mayo recibí el producto, el cual llegó al 96% de batería y no ha sido hasta el 31 de mayo cuando lo he puesto a cargar con un 4% de bateria y un uso..bastante elevado, por lo que es uno de sus mejores puntos.

Dicho esto, procedo a mencionar un pequeño resumen del producto:

* Bateria EXCELENTE y más con el precio que tiene el producto.
* Sonido muy aceptable y una cancelacion de ruido mejor de lo que pensaba que sería
* El volumen, ¿podría ser mejor? Si, ¿que aún así es bueno? MÁS que bueno, realmente sorprendida con el sonido.
* Adaptación a la oreja totalmente buena, no pesan, no molestan, no se caen y ante todo, no duelen, muy buena forma y al traer varios tamaños de oliva ayuda a que se pueda adaptar mejor al gusto.
* ¿El tamaño? imposible renegar del tamaño del estuche, es pequeño y cómodo si lo llevas en el bolsillo del pantalon y no se siente frágil ni el estuche ni los auriculares en si.
* Respecto a la conectividad, fueron muy faciles y rapidos de conectar por Bluetooth.

Recordar que la marca tiene su propia app para este tipo de dispositivos y poder personalizar un poco más el sonido y botones táctiles, es bastante sencilla y muy intuitiva. Espero que de cara al futuro su app si pueda optener otro tipo de mejoras.

Todo esto lo escribo tras haberlos comparado con otros dispositivos como Lg tone free fn6 y fp8 y unos energy system ESG 6 (De los cuales no tengo malas palabras y me han hecho ver que la calidad de estos xiaomi redmi buds 4 pro no tienen nada que envidiarles a otras marcas)

Espero que la reseña pueda ayudar a los indecisos como yo a decidirse por el producto ^^"
"Muy buen sonido,cómodos, la cancelación de ruido es buena más no excelente, el modo transparencia le falta ser pulido un poco pero funciona, recomiendo desactivar la conexión Dual, ya que cuando estás reproduciendo algo en un dispositivo y luego reproduces algo diferente en otro al momento de hacer el cambio se empieza a escuchar cortado y la solución es cambiar de modo cancelación de ruido a modo transparencia directo en los audífonos, a mí parecer son muy buenos audífonos y tiene muy buena duración de batería"
"Works great, good quality, the only real problem are:
- if you are having a phone call with them the person on the other side can hear each every thing going in the room, you clean the dishes? they gonna feel like they are in the sink

consider buying Galaxy Buds, in my opinion they are just a bit better"
"Non sono un fan di Xiaomi ma ho altri prodotti di cui sono soddisfatto per cui ho voluto provare questi auricolari.
Non sto a ripetere quanto già detto in altre recensioni, confermo solo quanto già detto da altri, comode, leggere, audio di buona qualità anche se non sono un grande esperto.
Le ho da un pò e mi sembrano un buon prodotto, la batteria ha una buona tenuta, non ne faccio un uso intensivo, ma mentre altri auricolari li dovevo ricaricare almeno ogni 4 giorni,
di questi la carica della custodia dura anche due settimane, forse con un uso intensivo regge meno, ma non posso affermarlo con certezza.
I comandi touch bisogna farci l'abitudine hanno una sagomatura strana che a me personalemnte confonde un pò al tatto, oltretutto non sono molto personalizzabili, hanno giusto qualche funzione preimpostata da poter assegnare per singolo auricolare, ma pessima combinazione:
- per i due tocchi c'è solo la possibilità di scelta ""riproduci/pausa"",""brano precedente"",""brano successivo""
- per i tre tocchi c'è solo la scelta con ""brano precedente"",""brano successivo"",""alza volume"", ""abbassa volume""
- per tocco prolungato ""assistenza vocale"",""cancellazione del rumore""

Avrei preferito una maggiore possibilità di scelta o quantomeno associazione in modo differente.

Unico appunto che devo fare ad AMAZON è di correggere la descrizione, è riportato ""ricarica wireless"" ma non è supportata, per la ricarica è necessario utilizzare il cavo usb in dotazione o equivalente."
"Los Redmi Buds 4 Pro son una adición interesante al mercado de auriculares inalámbricos a un precio asequible. Estos auriculares ofrecen una experiencia auditiva bastante buena para su rango de precio y tienen algunas características notables que los hacen destacar.

Lo que me gustó:

Calidad de sonido: Los Redmi Buds 4 Pro ofrecen una calidad de sonido sorprendentemente nítida y equilibrada para su precio. Los tonos graves son profundos sin abrumar, y los agudos son claros y detallados.

Cancelación de ruido: Aunque no rivalizan con los modelos premium en términos de cancelación de ruido, estos auriculares hacen un buen trabajo al bloquear el ruido ambiental, lo que es genial para disfrutar de la música en entornos ruidosos.

Duración de la batería: La duración de la batería es impresionante, ofreciendo horas de uso continuo con una sola carga. Además, el estuche de carga proporciona energía adicional y es muy conveniente para mantenerlos listos para su uso en movimiento.

Diseño y comodidad: Los auriculares son compactos y livianos, lo que los hace cómodos de llevar durante largos períodos de tiempo. Vienen con varios tamaños de almohadillas para los oídos para un ajuste personalizado.

Lo que podría mejorar:

Aplicación complementaria: Sería genial si Xiaomi desarrollara una aplicación complementaria para los Redmi Buds 4 Pro que permitiera una mayor personalización de las características, como ecualización y actualizaciones de firmware.

Control táctil: A veces, los controles táctiles pueden ser un poco sensibles, lo que puede llevar a acciones no deseadas al tocar los auriculares accidentalmente.

En resumen, los Redmi Buds 4 Pro son una opción sólida para quienes buscan una experiencia de audio inalámbrica sin gastar una fortuna. Ofrecen una calidad de sonido decente, cancelación de ruido aceptable y una excelente duración de batería. Si estás dispuesto a hacer concesiones en algunas áreas, estos auriculares te brindarán una experiencia satisfactoria por un precio atractivo."
Not even a year and the left earbud is playing much lower (not by earwax)
"it has good enough audio quality and has a good enough ANC, my only gripe for it is its fit, i never really tried shaking it or roughing it up a lot, but it feels kinda loose, that could just be my ear shape though, overall, pretty good product for a pretty good price, would recommend!"
"Good stuff, recommend."
"Ces écouteurs sont tops ! Je cherchais à en acheter depuis longtemps mais je ne trouvais rien qui soit abordable. Puis je suis tombé sur ceux là et je sais que Xiaomi fait des produits de qualité.

Le son est bon. Et le mode réduction de bruit ambiant est génial ! Quel plaisir d’être dans les transports et de ne pas entendre le bruit ambiant.

Il y a quelque bug de Bluetooth des fois mais rien de gênant."
Perfect
右のイヤホンだけ何をどうやってもうんともすんとも言わなくなり、安い買い物ではないので修理してもらおうと左右の本体とケースのみ返送したら、全額返金という決着になりAmazonカスタマーサービスの対応は迅速でした（ただ私としては音はすごく気に入ってたので、できれば修理して返してほしかった・・・）。
Nice song
"Me parecen más cómodos de llevar que los Buds 3, el aislamiento de sonido es muy bueno."
"المنتج جيد جدا فى المميزات الرئيسية الموجودة فى اى سماعة واقيمه بنسبة ٩ من ١٠
كنت اتمنى وجود خاصية الشحن اللاسلكى"
"Che i cinesi abusino delle lingue straniere è cosa nota e questi auricolari certamente non fanno eccezione. Definirli ""pro"" è sicuramente eccessivo, stiamo parlando di un decente prodotto di fascia pienamente economica.
L'audio è leggermente sbilanciato sui toni bassi, il che conseguentemente denota una pessima riproduzione di quelli alti.
Il microfono non è dei migliori e in diverse occasioni può capitare di sentire l'interlocutore lamentarsi del basso volume o della scarsa qualità della voce.
Le funzionalità aggiuntive sono poche e non vanno benissimo: la modalità trasparenza fa il suo lavoro ma restituisce un suono metallico e leggermente più alto del normale; l'isolamento dal rumore poi è ridicolo, pulisce sì l'audio in entrata ma rende la voce dell'interlocutore ridicolosamente ovattata e robotica; sostanzialmente gli auricolari funzionano decentemente solo se le funzionalità sono disattivate.
L'autonomia delle batterie è ottima, in pieno stile Xiaomi/Redmi, i comandi touch sono precisi ma molto scomodi per la posizione. E i lati positivi si fermano qui.
Sicuramente un passo avanti rispetto alle Buds 3 ma imitare esteticamente le AirPods non basta per realizzare un prodotto di qualità.
La strada è indubbiamente ancora lunga, sebbene per la fascia di prezzo difficilmente si trova di meglio."
"Compré varios audífonos y ejercitándome se me caían fácilmente. Compré estos audífonos y wow sorpresa. En estos momentos estoy haciendo ejercicio y todo al 100% sin caerse.

La calidad es similar a gama alta. Pueden ver en versus.com y hacer comparativa con cualquiera de gama alta y con algunos hasta los supera.

El precio mis accesible encontrando oferta o descuento. En promedio están en 1,200. Muy recomendables y vale la pena cada peso.

De las reseñas anteriores en una “desventaja” que veo es el volumen alto, para la mayoría está bien pero cuando estás haciendo ejercicio y te “emocionas con la música” quisieras que te reventaran el oído pero está MUY DECENTE.

Lo recomiendo al 100% amigos, no se arrepentirán"
"السماعه حلوه من حيث نقاء الصوت وسرعة الصوت بمعنى مناسبة للالعاب ولكن فيها عيبين .

الأول صوتها ضعيف حيث لو استخدمتها وأنت بتمشي في الشارع بتكون مش سامع كويس حتى لو استخدمت ميزه ازاله الضوضاء وخاصه لو كان المكان مزعج مثل الميترو أو الميكروباص .
ثانيا عند ايقاف وتغشيل الفيديوهات بشكل متكرر تلاحظ أنه في بعض الاوقات يشتغل الصوت في إذن واحدة فقط ولا يشتغل في الأخرى ويعود بعد وقت قصير أو إذا اطفات الفيديوا وشغلته من جديد أو يكون في تاخير بالتشغيل في بعض البرامج مثل برنامج ديولينجو ."
"Also:
Sonst hatte ich immer JBL-Kopfhörer, welche ich bis jetzt immer gut fand. Wollte aber mal andere ausprobieren und bin auf die Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 Pro gestoßen, welche gute Bewertungen hatten.
Nun mein Fazit:
Es sind im Preis-Leistungsverhältnis die besten Kopfhörer die man so finden kann in dieser Preis-Sektion.
Positiv:
- Sobald man sie aus dem Ohr nimmt geht die Musik / Video aus und beim einstecken wieder an
- ANC ist auch super (besser geht immer, aber für diesen Preis sehr gut)
- Transparentmodus ist auch überraschend gut geworden
- Tonqualität ist meiner Meinung nach fast genauso wie bei teureren Kopfhörern, absolut perfekt
- Kopfhörer wiederfinden funktioniert super
- Lautstärke ist super ausreichend
- in der App sieht man Perfekt den Akkustand vom Case und von jeden Kopfhörer

Das einzig negative ist vllt, dass für sehr gute Bass Freunde die Kopfhörer etwas zu schwach sind, aber für normale Lieder reicht er völlig aus.

Wenn ihr das hier lest, ist es eine AUFFORDERUNG diese Kopfhörer zu kaufen.
ABSOLUT EMPFEHLENSWERT
5/5★

Nachtrag:
Mit Xiaomi als auch Samsung Handy bzw. Tablet zu verbinden war sehr leicht mit
Bei PC mit win 10 dauert es etwas und man muss es irgendwie 2x verbinden ( denke das Case und die Kopfhörer extra) aber nach 5min funktionierte es auch"
"Beautiful sound quality, super comfortable, just perfect buds!"
"En este caso con el precio al que los cogí han sido buenos, bonitos y baratos. No se puede pedir más, buena calidad de sonido para el oído medio, buena duración de la batería, fácil de emparejar con el móvil..."
I like it
"There is a lack of bass, sounds very lean."
"Bons écouteurs. Le son est bon, ils sont un peu fat mais c'est pas les pires.
La connectivité fonctionne bien."
Very good sound quality
"Easy to use, fair quality comparing to the price"
"AirPods Pro（第一世代）の充電中に使う為に買ったが、
ノイズキャンセリングが弱すぎてガッカリした。

ほめてるレビューは、何なんだ？

Xiaomi Pad6 のコスパに感動して、これを買ったけれど、
Redmi Buds 4 Pro は、値段相応。"
"Premessa: queste sono le mie prime cuffie in ear che acquisto, essendo solitamente abituato a quelle over ear, pertanto non posso effettuare un confronto con altri modelli o con le stesse versione 3. Ciò detto, il prodotto mi sembra molto valido. Si sentono bene, isolano il suono abbastanza bene, sono confortevoli e aderiscono bene all'orecchio. Non le ho usate moltissimo fino ad ora, ma la batteria sembra reggere bene. L'associazione con il telefono (xiaomi redmi 11 light) è stata istantanea. Ad ogni modo è raccomndabile usare l'app apposita per eventuali personalizzazioni dei comandi. Le ho prese in sconto (60 eu al posto di 99). Le ho abbinate anche con la custodia in silicone così da proteggere anche l'involucro esterno. Se proprio devo trovare il pelo nell'uovo direi che il cavetto di ricarica (bianco) avrebbero potuto farlo dello stesso colore delle cuffie (che sono nere), ma è davvero una pignoleria. Prodotto consigliato"
السماعه اليمين وطيت ومعرفتش اخد فاتوره بالسيريال نامبر من امازون عشان اوديها التوكيل
"Los cascos tienen buen diseño y se notan materiales de buena calidad. La caja se siente robusta y tiene un tamaño muy reducido, lo que la hace súper cómoda.

El sonido está muy bien, no es el mejor del mundo pero no desmerece para nada.

La cancelación de ruido funciona genial. He leído comentarios de todo tipo, muchos de ellos diciendo que no sirve para nada. Mentira. No te aísla al 100%, pero he probado a activarlo y desactivarlo en la calle, rodeado de coches, autobuses, camiones, obras... Y es una maravilla, pasas de escuchar un montón de ruidos externos molestos a no enterarte de nada.

Por si alguien se lo pregunta, ambos auriculares funcionan de manera independiente. No es necesario que estén los dos conectados para que funcionen como he leído por ahí, el tema está en que al quitarte un casco el sonido se pausa automáticamente y tienes que volver a darle al play.

ACTUALIZACIÓN:

Tras algo más de un mes de uso constante la verdad que los cascos cumplen perfectamente con su función. En rasgos generales son muy cómodos, tienen muy buena calidad de sonido y la batería dura mucho tiempo sin necesidad de enchufar la caja de carga.

El único punto negativo que les he encontrado es al vincularlos con dos dispositivos simultáneamente. Al hacerlo se crean muchísimas interferencias y el audio se corta constantemente haciendo imposible utilizarlos de esta manera."
Good
"Plutôt vraiment satisfait du produit , je m'en sert a la salle de sport c'est ok aucun problème de tenue ou de longévité de la batterie 🔋 .. la réduction de bruit est appréciable pas nom plus impeccable .. le seul vrais bémole c'est le volume max que je trouve un peut juste mais apparemment tout les appareils de ce type répondent à de nouvelles normes ..."
"Justo lo que buscaba. Tienen buen tamaño, no siento que estén muy grandes y sean llamativos, quedan perfectos en los oidos.
El modo de transparencia es muy bueno para cuando estoy en el trabajo porque me permite escuchar bien cuando me hablan sin necesidad de poner pausa en la música o bajar mucho el volumen, las voces se escuchan bastante bien; el modo cancelación de ruido también es buenísimo, realmente me sorprendió el nivel que tiene de cancelación para el precio de los audífonos.
La duración de la batería creo es decente, me duran al rededor de 4 hrs seguidas, y el estuche me da para cargarlos otras 3-4 veces, además de que la carga es rápida."
لا انصح بشرائها لان المايك لا يعمل بشكل جيد اثناء الضوضاء مثل المرور فى الشارع
"Bonjour, J'ai un problème avec les Redmi Buds 4 pro
lors de la lecture de musiques ou de vidéos, il arrive assez fréquemment qu'il n'y ait que l'écouteur droit qui crépite et donc plus de son, et que je sois obligé de changer le mode pour que ça revienne à la normale. J'espère que ce bug sera résolu assez rapidement car c'est vraiment embêtant, surtout si on veut un mode de réduction de bruit bien précis alors ça oblige à changer le mode de réduction de bruit deux fois, et si comme parfois ça arrive, le bug se reproduit plusieurs fois de suite, ça devient vraiment agaçant. Cela survient sur beaucoup de plateformes, que ce soit l'application Musique, Youtube, Instagram ."
"I have used my set for two days. The 36-hour claim is a lie. the thing does not even last for two hours. It was at 100% while I was leaving the office, before I reached home the thing was off which was less than 2hrs. total disappointment. The other day It was the same. the thing could not allow me to enjoy my music for two hours. I am really disappointed."

"Very good quality headphones, just lost"
Se adaptan muy bien y cumple lo que promete
My dog has a habit of destroying my earbuds. I've been buying redmi for years due to their high quality for the price. However these have been incredibly frustrating to use. I've been through two sets and both of them have charging issues. I'm not trying a third. I will just move on to a different brand. The issue seems to be the case. It lights up when charging but often will stop charging almost immediately. Even if the ear buds and case are dead as a doornail. Also have had some connection issues but those are minor. It really sucks to go use your earbuds after they were plugged in all night just to find out they are dead.
"I had better ones, sound quality is on the average."
No
Lo recomiendo 100%
Si es muy bueno los audífonos son muy elegantes pero la cancelación de ruedo está más o menos pero depsues de eso está muy bien
"I recently bought this because I used to have a pair of Redmi buds 3 lite and had a very good sound quality/price experience with them until one day, after a year of use, one of them stopped working properly (couldn't pair the left earbud even after several factory reset).

Now, I decided to give it another try but the experience is worse. This time I couldn't even use them correctly for the first time.

The left earbud's led light is only turned on when it is inside the case. When I take both earbuds out, only the right one (100% charged) blinks and is able to pair with my phone (Xiaomi Mi A3). Left earbud does not blinks, does not pairs. I've tried factory reset but it's only possible with the right one. I love Xiaomi but I'm very disappointed this time.

Some of you may have the luck of buying and getting a non defective pair and have a great experience as I had at first. But I definitely do not recommend you to take the risk because it seems to be a common problem with this product."
👍
"Had the redmi airdots, one of them got lost, and was looking a replacement these were perfect as the replacement. The sound quality is good, to listen music or even watching videos."
"Los compré porque tenían muy buenas referencias pero al menos los que me llegaron a mi no son del todo buenos. El primer día les di 12 horas de carga porque al venir con los preservantes debían estar descargados, al día siguiente la batería debía estar completa para que me duraran 5 horas los audífonos 20 horas la cajita…..PUES NO. Al otro día el auricular derecho solo dura dos horas, se le acaba la batería y sigue andando el otro solo. En el móvil me dice con los dos auriculares que la batería es de 80% y cuando se apaga el derecho dice que 100%. Así me pase el segundo y parte del tercer día….recargando auriculares.
También cuando hablo por teléfono me dicen mis amigos que se escucha más ruido que los Xiaomi anteriores que tengo que son de hace como 3 años."
Sounds is OK -- Battery life is ridiculously short. These are now just sitting on a shelf -- the 3 year old $20 ones I got from the Grocery Store checkout line are actually quite a bit better and preferred. Really could not recommend these.
"Muy fácil conexión
No tienen muy buen sonido"
"Lastimosamente no tengo una buena experiencia con este producto, Los auriculares tienen un error de fábrica, el auricular izquierdo no funciona solo el derecho.

Afortunadamente el Servicio al cliente del Vendor fue muy responsable y me ayuda con mi problema.

Estoy muy triste de que por mi mala suerte me toco un producto dañado, ya que este producto tiene muy buenas reseñas."
"I bought 3 of these for me and my friends. The one I took (fortunately) has a defective bud, the right one. It doesn't turn ON. The left one goes from 90% battery to 20% in less than 15 minutes. First time I made a so regretful purchase on Amazon. My first reaction wouldn't be to review as I haven't contacted the seller yet, but I can't find a way to contact them directly.
Edit: I managed to contact them and the were happy to help me resolve the problem."
"They fit comfortably, so much so it's easy to forget they are in.
The audio is clean and good for music but that's it, just good.
Bass is pretty much nonexistent, and they don't get very loud but enough so to where you can block out outside noise.
For the price audio is clear they fit really well.
I would recommend a try."
"The product fulfil the price I paid for it the noise cancelation is acceptable and the sound quality is no the best but it's ok, the battery duration is perfect you can listen to music for 1 or 2 days with the box charging"
"Buena fabricación, buen empaque, fácil conexión. Recomendado"
"Si necesitas audífonos existen mejores compras por el mismo precio, no tiene cancelación de ruido y el táctil no responde muy bien. 6/10"
"This might be my bad luck, but one of the earpods stopped working after one week , they didn't fell or anything , just stopped working out of nowhere."
"Calidad ni buena ni mala, normal. Limitados en las funciones de sus controles, potencia de sonido limitada. Recomendado para un uso básico, si te gusta la música busca otras opciones"
"Right bud connect to the device but this disconnect immediately I play the video or music. I assume is something with the internal battery, but I don't know. I bought them just in August"
Se desconfiguraron a los 3 meses y aun no logro pa
Buena duración de batería y buen sonido sin llegar a ser considerados con cancelación de ruidos. Buen precio
These are decent ear buds
"The sound quality is good, however the charge on the buds don't last as long as they say it would. The left earbud just dies like an hour after being fully charged and the right one doesn't last much longer."
The pause option is not as expected.
Muy bueno.
Muy buenos auriculares.
My ear buds worked for a few weeks after purchasing then the left ear bud completely stopped charging. The sound quality is ok and the background noise seems to tolerable I had no complaints there but the main thing is only one works and the battery life sucks
First day ，did not work ，return immediately
"*week 1 update, they will not charge anymore. DO NOT BUY. I loved my old Xiaomi buds so I grabbed these because they looked to be the same form factor and all that. They switched to a touch button that is way too janky. Never works quite right. and they added some weird rubber collar with a fin for ear customization....well they suck. They dont help with retention they just hurt your ears. Forcing you to fiddle with it, thus making that janky touch button turn your music off. It's just bad design."
"Play Video
Compre unos exactamente iguales anteriormente, también en Amazon, pero tuve que devolverlos por que tenían el mismo defecto, van 2 audífonos que voy comprando y traen el mismo error en el mismo auricular.

El derecho no carga, por que los pines de carga no tocan completamente a los pines que tre el estuche de carga, simplemente una basura total, es una pérdida de dinero y tiempo.

Dos veces compré los mismos y dos veces me vinieron defectuosos e inservibles."
"si tienes orejitas pequeñas, no te los compres te van a quedar nadando"
"Al principio no quería hacer el Match con mi celular, no sube muy alto el volumen, y uno de los dos se descarga súper rápido, ni dos minutos dura. Peor calidad en comparación a un modelo anterior de Xiaomi."
Lo uso para ejercitarme y es muy bueno al momento de sudar no interfiere con el uso. El sonido es bueno aunque no excelente.
"Solo me funciona una sola bocina, pedi el cambio y me enviaron otras pero siguen con el mismo problema, tenia que devolver las primeras pero enviarselas me sale mas caro que la mismas bocinas."
Very nice headphones!
es muy buen producto recomendable para XIAOMI
Lo único que tiene es que constante solo dura la batería una 5 horas pero del resto cumplió mucho mis expectativas
The sound is very poor. The earbuds only hold charge one hour. Never deal with Mi again
"Los pedí porque siempre utilicé equipos xiaomi primero me llegaron y uno de los dos audífonos no encendía, pedí q me enviaran otros y entonces uno de ellos nunca carga al 100 por ciento de carga y se apaga mucho antes q el otro, casualmente el problema siempre lo da el izquierdo no sé si será casualidad y tengo la peor suerte del mundo, estoy pensando en devolverlos q me devuelvan el dinero y comprar de otra marca, una lastima q no se pueda poner media estrella e incluso ninguna"
"We bought it while in the US and it worked well for a short period of time. Then one side stopped working and we were no longer in the US to return it. Tried to get someone to repair it without success. So, it ended up being a loss."
Bien
They had good sound quality and ok noise cancellation
Excelente terminado y excelente sonido
Product is good. Sound quality is very good. But I didn't receive charging cable.
"No pensaba que iban a funcionar tambien para llamadas, pero me sorprendió"
They’re a cheap pair and do the job

"Play Video
Todo estuvo muy bien, a la semana el auricular derecho dejó de funcionar de la nada, porque nunca lo dejé caer ni los maltraté, ahora solo puedo usar un solo auricular porque el derecho solo se conecta a mi celular y le funcional el touch pero no sé escucha nada, muy decepcionada del producto."
"Antes de un mes de uso el audífono izquierdo dejó de funcionar y no ha cumplido dos meses de la compra y ya no carga , lo pongo a cargar y la carga no dura 3 minutos !!!!"
"Los audífonos lo único que hacen, aparentemente, es cargar, ya qué cuando están el la cajita se mantiene con las luces encendidas; lleva así desde que los recibí hace dos días. Los audífonos ni siquiera aparecen como dispositivo para conectar y los botones táctiles no reciben ningún tipo de interacción.
Lamentablemente desde el país que estoy, es muy complicado hacer devolución, así que me quedé sin el dinero y sin los audífonos."
"Since I bought them, I could never pair the buds to any phone. I tried with iPhone, Motorola, and Samsung, and I still can't use them.
Tried everything, watching YouTube videos, and reading the manual a thousand times, and nothing works.
Worst of all, I bought them as a gift and now I have to buy another brand because these are useless"
"I bought this Wireless Earbuds in January 9,
I didn't have chance to use it because arrived when I was no vacation away from home, so i just had a chance to use it now, and i realized that de left side is not charging.
Please let me know how can i fix it."
""
"Nice, minimalist earbuds. Very small case. Very comfortable fit."
"Excelentes, muy buenos, estoy agradecido por la compra"
These headphones were difficult to pair with my new television and continued to cut out. I used them for about 25-30 minutes at a time in the morning before work and they often would die or stop working after one use even though they were fully charged. I can’t recommend these headphones.
Everything
Just one earbud works
Pésima inversión yo compre dos y de los dos me salieron fallados los envié a mi país de regalo y quedé mal porque no cargan o solo uno funciona y llame y nunca me regresaron mi dinero ni nada
Muy buenos
Comfortable
"el articulo es original, llego bien empacado, cargan normalmente pero no prenden al sacarlos de la caja, hice de todo para hacerlos funcionar, de tanto intentar funciono uno, el otro de ninguna forma logre prenderlo, ni con resetearlo, por eso hice devolucion."
Fall from ears easily. Battery life is too short.
"No se como los fabricantes venden productos sin ellos probarlos,,,estos no encienden,e buscado tutoriales y no logro encenderlos,,, están defectuosos"
"One of the headphones just doesn't work! I did everything possible, reset and it does not work. The worst thing is that because I don't live in the USA, I can't return it or call assistance"
"After a couple of months using it the light on the left bud started to blink constantly and we cant pair it , disconnect it or listen.
Amazing how quick the issues started
Buy JBL instead not this."
Está muy bien
"Cuando abrí el estuche de los audífonos el del lado derecho se desarmo por completo, solo quedó unido por el cableado"
"Desde que los sawue de la caja no se quisieron conectar, y es un error recurrente en el modelo según estuve investigando, son buenos pero se arriesgan a que les salga defectuoso"
The casing is easily unlocked and that ends up damaging connections
"El sonido es bastante bueno en el auricular derecho, pero el izquierdo no funciona y no se puede conectar a Bluetooth. Leí otras opiniones con el mismo problema, supongo que es algo general con este modelo."
"No me agrado en lo absoluto, ya que vinieron dañados y como no los estrene de inmediato perdí la garantía que solamente es de un mes 🙄"
"Me salió defectuoso no quieren conectar a Bluetooth
Cómo me podrían ayudar con este artículo"
"Los compré para mi hermano que vive en otro país, llegaron y no servía un audífono y el que si prendía no se conectaba al Bluetooth"
No sé conecta con ningún celular de las casa y en una hora solo prende el izquierdo
This is how I receive my Redmi buds 3 lite. Poor quality control on this product.
"Estoy tratando de comunicarme y no he podido, estoy muy disgustado ya que solo funciona el audicular derecho"
I can't even use the headphones. One of the earpieces does not work. It failed to connect to my phone and does not show the white light to indicate charging. Waste of money
Earpods came broken. As I opened it pieces fell out.
Stopped working after a week
"Solo funciona uno, el otro nunca funcionó."
"No me agradó, perdí mi dinero, ya que la devolución desde mi país sale más caro que el artículo."
Everything is bad in this model. Nothing nice.
"No cargan, no se emparejan al celular, el audífono izquierdo no parpadeo nunca y el derecho dejó de hacerlo al día de abrirlo"
CADA VEZ ES PEOR ES EL SEGUNDO QUE COMPRO Y NADA TIENE QUE VER.....SONIDO PESIMO....SINCRONIZACION MALISIMA SE DESCONECTA EN CONVERSACION ...BUENO LO PEOR
Lo compre para envío a mi país lo malo es que no lo puedo regresar y no vale el audífonos del lado izquierdo
the battery of one bud died and got swollen.. Stopped working so fast. low quality
The left earbud didn't turn on.

"Sound Quality: Outstanding! These things blew away my old Apple earbuds, with deep lows and crackle-free highs. I've used Skullcandy and Apple, wired and wireless, and I've NEVER had sound this good and battery life this long. For the longest time I was forced to use an amplifier app in order to get my music to an acceptable volume, but I've finally been able to ditch it.

Ease of Use: I honestly didn't even need the pamphlet that came with it, and haven't needed it. Just pull them out of the case and they immediately show up on the phone's Bluetooth connection for pairing. One click and they're off and running.

Comfort: Fine for a few hours, but after that they DO become a little uncomfortable to wear; you don't really notice until you remove them, though.

Stability: I must have weird ear canals, because I've never been able to keep silicone-tipped earbuds properly inserted, regardless of the size used. They ALL fall out with the smallest movement of my head. Even something as innocuous as a yawn or smile will pop them out and send them bouncing. Not these! They stay sitting just inside the ear and are firmly seated; I've even done yard work with them, without so much as a jiggle. Unaffected by sweat, but I wouldn't advise showering with them. Just in case.

Appearance: Sleek, black design with a great LED indicator on the case showing charging and battery status. Has some heft to it, so it definitely doesn't feel cheap. The earbuds themselves are also pretty solid, BUT remember they are still delicate instruments; a short fall onto a hard, dense surface may well degrade their sound quality, or wreck the internal circuitry entirely. But the same can be said of $200+ earbuds.

All in all, I couldn't be happier! If in the future these should turn out to live less than a year (barring unforseen accidents), I'll buy another set anyway. The quality is the best I've discovered at this unbeatable price point. 100% recommended!

Note: I am NOT an audiophile, so if you're capable of hearing sounds that even dogs miss, I can't vouch for whether or not these are for you. But for the average, everyday ear...yes. Unequivocally."
"These wireless Bluetooth earbuds are a game-changer for on-the-go listening! The sound quality is exceptional, with clear highs and deep bass that make any music or podcast enjoyable. The Bluetooth connection is stable and easy to pair with my devices, and I love the true wireless design for maximum freedom of movement. Battery life is impressive, lasting through multiple workouts and commutes on a single charge. They’re also comfortable to wear for extended periods, thanks to the ergonomic design. Overall, these earbuds offer great performance, convenience, and comfort—highly recommended!"
"I recently purchased the wireless earbuds, 5.3 Headphones .The delivery was fast and reliable. The sound quality is very good. The cost is very decent and the lifetime of the Battery is long approximately 8 hr for continuous song play. The earbud does not hurt my ear and is stable in my ear while working around. The sound control touch screen at the earbud tip is very good and sensitive for small touch. I like this feature, it is very convenient to receive call and play music or stop music as needed. The charging is easy and I can use my laptop to charge pod, and it last for almost week of charging earbuds."
"I've been using these wireless earbuds for a few weeks now on my Peloton and I'm totally hooked. The sound is crisp and clear – perfect for my workouts. Plus, the battery life is insane! I can days without needing to charge the case. They're comfy too, and haven't fallen out once. Definitely worth the money!"
Long battery life and decent sound quality. Negative is they do not fit firmly in your ear so they often fall out
"I'm really impressed by these Wireless Earbuds! They fit perfectly in my ears and are way more comfortable and lightweight compared to others I’ve tried. The sound quality is excellent for music, podcasts, and calls.

I didn't have any issues connecting Bluetooth, they automaticly paired. The touch controls make it easy to manage everything right on the earbuds without pulling out my phone. So far the battery life is excellent too. I like that they are waterproof, so when I wear them to the gym I don't have to worry or if I get caught in the rain! Overall, I highly recommend!"
"I use these daily for when I’m out in my garden to elevate my mood, and for calls (personal and work). They last me hours and are easy to navigate. They don’t fall out of my ear like others have and I’m bending down and back up a ton when gardening. The people on the other end of the call can hear me great. They sit comfortably in my ear, sound is awesome, and battery is decent. I’d order these again. I do wish the range went a little further but I just bring my phone with me outside when I’m gardening so I don’t lose range. I also love that they self recharge."
"They are made of really good quality. They hold the charge for longer than I expected. The sound is very good quality. The fit was good, really good product for the price I would buy them again."
"I purchased this to replace my overpriced airpods and I can proudly say that I made the right choice! The sound quality is amazing, fits in my ear comfortably, and battery life is long! I’ve only needed to charge few times since my purchase two months ago! Also, I accidentally found out that you can control sounds by touching the earbuds! Ha! The price makes it all worth it! I’d definitely skip on spending hundreds on airpods and go with this one from now on!"
"I got these earbuds and was worried because when I got them they were on sale for $19.99. I thought for sure I was going to use them and be disappointed by the sound quality and battery life. I must say I'm pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth the $20! If you are looking for some earbuds and are scrolling through hundreds not knowing which ones to pick....get these!!! The sound quality is amazing, the battery life is longer than I expected, and pairing them to my phone was simple. I have not used them for calls, yet, but assume it's going to get the job done. I have no negative comments. I took a chance and I'm glad I did. I use these at work every day and didn't spend hundreds."
"Love these little earbuds so much, I've ordered a couple pairs. They are comfortable and don't fall out of your ear, they have great sound and love that the case shows you how much of a charge the buds have. Can't say enough great things about these earbuds."
I only use earbuds with my phone when I go on long road trips with my family. I had always just used the wired version until I realized my new phone does not have a jack. My kids informed me it was time to join the rest of the world and go wireless! I didn't want the kind with little pieces that shove in my ear--they never fit. My daughter suggested these. I loved them. They sat comfortably in my ears and did not fall out. We were in the car about 11 hours and I never had any trouble with them. I could watch movies on my phone and hear perfectly while my husband listened to the car radio. The sound was crisp and clear--much better than the wired ones I was use to. They were very easy to pair with my phone and keep a long charge. I am very pleased with this purchase. I wish I had bought some sooner! I would never feel the need to buy the expensive brands. These get the job done!
"I got these headphones for my trip to Spain, I had a LONG flight and I wanted to make sure i could cancel out the sound of others around me! These did just the trick and stayed in my ears!"
"Very surprised by the sound quality. Touch options are finicky. But they do work. There is a learning curve for sure. Easy pairing with Bluetooth. Can use one or 2 at a time. Quick charge. Last me around 6hr at medium volume. Turned all the way up they are
loud but not too loud to hurt your ear drum. I love them. Phone calls are clear and people hear me just fine. Definitely recommend these for the price. Great quality sound best bang for the buck!!
Update.

They are freaking amazing. Buy them!! Last around 6hr on a full charge. I use one at a time at work. They will pair with phone even if watch is connected too!! Great buy"
These ear buds are comfortable with great sound. They were easy to set up with my iphone and I love being able to see the amount of charge they have left every time I remove them from the case. I never get caught with “dead” earbuds! They are definitely worth the price!
"My wife and I have been dealing with wires and headphones for years. Wired ear buds are always breaking. Headphones felt like our heads were in a vice after 30 minutes. We ordered two sets to see about wireless. Couldn’t resist the price. They arrived quickly and we set them up in no time at all. Quality sound, comfortable and can barely feel them in our ears. We are very satisfied and it’s made private hearing a pleasure. We will never be without your product again. The charge lasts a long time which is great."
It's hard for me to find ear buds that don't fall out of my ears. These are a tad loose but a great fit. Sound quality is great. Very good easy to set up and use.
"Lost the Apple ear pods, read the reviews and bought these. They sound identical to the Apple Ear pods. The design is a bit different, but that’s all I can say that’s not the same. Give these a try, you’ll be writing a review like me soon!"
"I purchased these earbuds because my apple airpods broke. Looking for something cheaper. So glad I did.
Not only is the sound amazing but so easy to pair with my phone. The charge lasts almost three full day. When I do need to charge them its done in no time at all. When I purchased them, I wasn't aware they were waterproof. This was a special bonus as I paddle board a lot. Been telling family & friends about them. Even picked up an extra pair for myself. You can't go wrong!"
"These don't fit my ear canals too well so they will slip and loosen up after a short while but they sound great while they are on. I will stick to the other style with the rear pieces, they seem to fit my ears better."
"LOVE THESE! battery last forever, charges fast, they fit perfectly in my ears, and they are loud. shipping was super fast. bluetooth connection is always fast and i will be getting another pair for my daughter!"
"Good quality at a good price. They are comfortable, easy to use, no issues at all. I like that the charging case displays the % of how much battery is charged up. Battery life is good."
"Airpods have always been uncomfortable in my ears but these are quite light and comfortable to my ears. Also, does not break the bank like the airpods. The stability is good and has good charge. The ease of setup is a breeze."
"Works exactly as described, great earbuds for the price! Doesn't fall out and connects right away."
The right earbud is loose in my ear but aside from that they have great sound output they last long with the charging case.
"Was hesitant to buy these, but am glad I did. Work well and are comfortable."
I love the style of these headphones. I love that they are wireless. They sound great and are very loud! I highly recommend if you are looking for a good pair of earphones!
These are great for the price. They hold a charge well. The sound quality is good. They're comfortable. I'm very happy with my purchase.
They sound really good. Hold charge for many hours. I like them.
"They work and that's the important part. I feel like your ears have to be the ""perfect"" size for them not to be painful. The sound is just ok, but they get the job done. I'm glad I bought these while they where on sale because I would be angry if I had paid $70 for these. In my opinion, that's WAY too much for the quality.

That being said, customer service was pretty amazing and worked with me by refunding my order. They also said something about upgrading their product."
"Sound quality is excellent, they work amazing ! If your looking for earbuds these are the ones.. Must buy!"
"I am a big review reader so I am happy to write a review for these earbuds. One reason I picked Rinsmola earbuds was the length of charge, the charge lasts an amazing length of time. I like that when you put the earbuds away it shows how much charge is left on the earbuds. The charge is very long lasting.
Another reason was that they are waterproof!! You know at some point they will fall into liquid. Rinsmola, has a great product and would suggest their product to other people happily."
"From my experience I’d say this earbuds are durable, has a long battery life and honestly if you’re not looking for something too pricey and reliable I’d recommend this earbuds. It’s worth it"
That they did look namebrand?
"Live the styles,fit good. But can't them to work.hear a buzz and that's it."
I bought these ear buds to wear when I walk my dogs and work. They do not disappoint! I'm told that I sound very clear when I take a call. I love the front that shows me how much life I have left. Definitely would recommend!!
I like the fact that they aren't noise canceling and I can hear around me when I'm at the gym or if someone tried to talk to me. Good sound and kind of bass-y
Dura bastante su bateria
The sound comes through clearly and they're snug tight in your ears that they don't fall out easily. Connect to Bluetooth quickly and easily.
"I recently discovered I have an allergy to silicone and all my Earbuds used it. I thought this would be a perfect occasion to upgrade to wireless. I got a pair both for me and my mom. We both love them. Easy to pair with your phone, quick charge, they stay in your ear, and all around do what I need."
Easy to match to my LG wing. Lightweight and sound great.
LOVE THEM.... AUDIO IS EXCELLENT!!!!!
It is easy to pause and play and lower and raise the volume
They're exactly what I needed
"They are hard plastic, keep that in mind when ordering, make sure to get them in the right size for your ear. Customer service is quick and professional if there's an issue. I love the pink color they came in."
"Disappointing for sure. They worked great about five or six times but now one of the earbuds won’t charge and only one of them plays.

UPDATE: Customer service provided a new working pair. Seller did a good job of fixing the issue."
"I love that you see how much battery is left, before you go to the gym and the battery wears out right as you start your work-out. I never have to listen to gym music again. Easy to pair, easy to charge, sounds great for a fantastic price."
I love these headphones so much! They quickly connected to my phone and they stay charged forever!! And on top of all that they are super affordable!!
These are a good set of headphones. They fit well in the ear and have great sound. The display showing the battery life is a nice touch
Very affordable and they’re just like the AirPods! Charging case lets me know the percentage of the battery case. They are also extremely comfortable.
Great product love the color will buy something else again.
i'm blown away by the audio quality on these earbuds!! they sound AMAZING! seriously beats my old airpods. and the sound does not leak!!! totally recommend.
I bought these for my 12 year old son to use. He has really small ears and we have such a hard time finding ear pods that will fit comfortably in his ears. He loves these ear pods and uses them everyday. He especially loves that you can see the amount of charge left on the case. Great quality and are portable to take where ever he goes.
"It’s nice , work very well plus it’s light to put it in your pocket"
"I got these headphones to do chores with, they were reasonably priced. I can even cut the grass and still hear my music."
"I was skeptical because of the price, but I am completely satisfied with performance of this product. I have recommended them to others!!!"
The earbuds always connect. It was easy to set up initially also. They stay charged for over a week with daily use.
Product was delivered on time and met all my expectations.
"El sonido es nítido y claro. Además, la duración de la batería es increíble, ¡Definitivamente valen la pena!"
I'm impressed by the battery life of this! The sounds are good--comparable to other expensive brands. Definitely a good buy and worth the cost. Reasonable for what I need when I'm doing chores around the house.
I brought these for my husband recently. He loves them! They work great and the charge on them lasts a long time. Definitely worth it!
I bought these for my son to use at school. He’s pretty particular about earbuds & he says these are awesome- way better than others we’ve tried. Easy connection & clear audio- you can’t beat that for the price!
"Sound is great, Very easy to pair up with phone and comfortable to wear."
This is my second order as more family members wanted these ear buds. Great value.
Great fit in the ear. Great sound quality. Great price. I’m really glad I choose these earbuds 👍
"I really liked this headphones, easy to use, lightweight, perfect case to fit easy. The quality of sound is amazing and the battery last for the day."
This is a Great device. The audio is awesome. I use it when walking or hiking and enjoying music or using my phone. I like the way you can store the earpieces in the case and charge them and get the status on the charge. I am really big on looking at reviews and trying to tell people what I think of products so you're not buying junk or inferior products. I give them Five Stars and highly recommend them.
"These ear buds hold up to the top tier name brands when it comes to sound, look, battery lasting time and comfort. They are very use to sync, and the battery percentage on the outside is convenient to see how much charge you have left. Great for people who are really into headphones or someone that just casually listens. Highly recommend for anyone!"
"Great price, fit well, fast charging"
Worked like a champ. Paired effortlessly. Why pay for iPods I was just going to lose anyway?
I use these daily at the gym and so happy with the choice I made. The sound quality is awesome.
These have good sound clarity and connected easily to several of my devices. Seems to have a good battery life as well before needing to be recharged. I wanted a pair of wireless earbuds but didn’t want to spend a crazy amount on them. Found these and have been enjoying them. Also bought a second pair for my mister for his birthday.
Work is loud..sound is clear
"I bought these headed phone for my husband and he loves them they took 3-5 days to go dead after working an 8 hour day and right now they are at 57%. But check this out he has not charged them for a week this time(7days). They aren’t big or bulky and the case is small.
Now you can judge them for yourself but just say I told you so!"
Works pretty good. Case lid got loose and had to tape it closed to keep the earpieces charging. But other than that they are very nice little earbuds
These have excellent battery life and the sound quality is wonderful! They are very comfortable in my ears to wear for hours while I am working. These are a great value for the price!
First ear pods ever and I'm very happy with this purchase. The quality and sound is great and the price was right.
"Excelente calidad, superaron mis expectativas, duran mucho de batería"
"I bought these for a trip going by myself. Just a nice pair of wireless earbuds. These wayyy surpassed my expectations. Great sound, battery lasts a long time, just an all around good purchase!"
"These earbuds fit well. When you charge the holder, the earbuds stay charged for awhile. Not yet sure how to move tracks forward or pause tracks. I'll figure it out. Would recommend."
Comfortable and stays in place and of course the sound quality is great.
Great product. Would recommend. The sounds is good they also stay in my ear. Thanks.
"My husband wears these to run, mow, and work out with. He says they are great! And for the price you can’t beat them!!"
"Love these earbuds
Takes a little time to connect at first but once connected, they’re awesome. These are the best earbuds I’ve bought so far"
Sound is great. Holds charge a long time.
These are seriously so good ! I’ve had so many air pods and these are definitely better I recommend these over air pods any day. Very clear and gets very loud if you want to cancel noise 10/10 recommend 😊
"This a great value for your money, the product is well build, the quality of the sound is awesome, charges quickly and connects to Bluetooth very easily!"
Good earbuds. Only wish would be for a lower lowest volume.
"I went through a handful of wireless earbuds before finding these and am happy the search is over. They are comfortable to wear while sleeping, which I don't even think they are advertised that way, and they have great sound quality."
"This was a great value. Sound quality is excellent, I can't tell the difference between these and my 5x more expensive Samsung buds. And the connection is better, my Samsungs would have spotty connectivity with my android watch while running if I wore the watch on the left like I normally do. These perform better with bluetooth connection. Also I like the fact that one tap adjusts the volume rather than play/pause. So if you need to adjust them in your ears it doesn't mess with the playback. I got these for exercise outdoors and I did not want too much sound isolation. These strike a good balance. They seat firmly in your ears during vigorous activities as well."
They stay charged for a long time I love these headphones they are awesome 👏🏾 & worth the price 🫶🏽🤞🏾
"I really like this product -- it works! The sound is good and the charging and charged indicators are clear.
Many of the earbuds I have bought in the past fall out of my ears, but these stay in place, that is a BIG plus for me!"
Upgrading my older and larger ear buds . found these and they were just what I was looking for ! smaller and have great sound ! Used for exercising and not making other people share what I listen to ! They also pair quickly !
"The volume quality is fantastic. It seems to fit my right ear less well than my left, but as I'm not sure if that's the product or just my ear I won't lessen the rating. This is a backup replacement for my airpods and I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
"I really like the battery level display for the earbuds. I also like that the controls are intuitive. Sound quality is adequate for music. It is a little difficult to remove the earbuds from the case initially, but it becomes easier with practice. Overall, these get the job done."
Was looking for a second set of earphones; these are great. The quality of earphone is great. I really like the ability to actually see digital how much charge the earphone has. It was easy to connect to my phone and I have had no issues.
"These look and feel very nice. Great quality. They sound great, and have a long battery life. Wonderful value."
Nice sound and very loud to hear I like them a lot
"These earbuds are so fantastic that I ordered a spare set. They fit comfortably, stay in your ears while working out, and are very easy to charge and stay charged for a long period of time. They are so crystal clear that you feel like you are at a real live concert!"
Light weight easy to use great sound
"I don't go out of my way to leave a lot of reviews. But I figured I was so impressed with these that I would go ahead and leave a review. I purchased these a few days ago and I'm extremely pleased with the whole experience. Let me tell you the reasons why. I have something that you might describe as a shopping addiction lol. When I'm looking to purchase something, I will spend hours looking at every option before I finally pull the trigger. It was no different with this purchase. When going online and looking for earbuds that are less than $30, there are hundreds of choices. Most of them have great reviews and seem to be made pretty well. What sets these apart from the others are some pretty cool features.

First, these will work with Siri through the earbud itself and not through the cell phone. Most inexpensive earbuds only work with Siri if you click it four times which is very difficult to do. These will work just like your airpods work. Which for me, is really cool since I used these for biking. I don't have to be clicking anything 4 times to skip songs or to play something different. And before anybody starts, I only put one in my right ear at a low level so I can hear traffic coming lol.

They definitely hold the charge well. Which is good, because it's a pain in the neck for cheaper earbuds to have to be charging them every time you use them for a few hours. Also, the sound quality is absolutely amazing for the money. I have about four or five different sets of earbuds and one of them is an Apple Airpod. I don't know which generation. But I do know that these sound a little better than all of them. If you like deep bace and Crystal Clear sound, you'll love these. They have all that and more.

They also have an app that you can use as an equalizer. You can use the 16 preset ones that are offered and they also post hundreds of other equalizer programs that you can try on your own. Of course you can also do your own custom equalizer . This is really cool for me since Apple Music does not offer an equalizer. Only the one on my IPhone 14+ and theirs is better.

They will also do wireless charging, which I'm not sure if I'm happy about that or not since I don't ever use it. I guess I should try it. Pretty much most better phones all come with wireless charging these days. It seems to be the wave of the future. so I’ll go out and get a wireless charger after searching online for hours lol.

The app that you have to download also has one button that you click to register for an 18-month warranty. Which is pretty cool since most sub $50 earbuds don't offer anything like this at all. From what I've read, their customer service is pretty decent, let's hope that's true.

The case is also a little bit smaller than most of the others that I have. Which I like since I can fit them into my pocket easily. They also have the battery charged status on the cover. All my others do not have this. I have to guess whether they're going to last or not when I take them out for the day. So this feature I really like. I’ve used them for four or five hours at a time and not had any issues with the charge status going below 20%. They also come with six sets of very comfortable earbuds caps. I'm not sure of the cool name, but you get the idea.

The earbuds connect effortlessly to my phone. I was happy with that since I have others that are real hassle to get them moving. A few of them, I have to open and close the case several times to get them to connect. Keep in mind this might be me because I’m kind of an idiot at times. But at least I’m honest lol

. I've also gone into several different rooms 30 to 40 ft away and I didn't lose any connections. I have a few sets of earbuds that are always fading in or out if I sneeze the wrong way.

A lot of these Amazon purchases that have glowing reviews are because the seller is somehow monetarily enticing people to leave a great review. I purchased these on my own at the full price and nobody is asking me to write anything lol. But since I was so impressed, I figured I would just fill you in on my thoughts.

As far as longevity though, I don't really know. But I'm guessing they'll hold up pretty well. But in my mind, I can just buy another set if they become broken or lost and keep doing that for about 5 years before I get to the price of one set Apple Airpod lol. I can promise you that you will love these. Good luck and thank you for reading."
"I picked these ear buds up based off of the raving reviews and I am not disappointed! These by far exceed my needs. I only use these to listen to music and for my workouts so I can't say how they are during phone calls. For music, they are great and sound a lot more expensive. They stay in my ears, and I have had no connection issues while I am active. I was surprised by how light they are so you don't really even notice them. One of my favorite features is the battery level displayed on the case when you open and close the lid. I can't tell you how many times I grab an older set I have, pop them in just to see the battery levels are low. I often don't even see the battery level until I run out the door and connect them to my phone. With these, I get a battery level reading at first glance. It even has wireless charging. The only downside with the wireless charging for me is I have a charging station that props your device up. and the case has the wireless charging connection on the bottom of the case. I have to set this case up facing on it's side which is not ideal. You can see in a picture I provided. This won't be an issue if you have a wireless charging pad. My other earbud case has wireless charging on the back side of the case so you can place it face up on a pad or facing out on the prop up charger. Either way it still works so I can't knock it too much. The noise cancelling is not active, so I feel these are not the best in that class. Overall, I highly recommend the Tozo T20 if you want earbuds that are affordable, sound amazing, have great battery, and are super comfortable!"
"I've been using these TOZO T20 for several weeks and I'm really enjoying them. Some of the reasons:
--They connected easily to my phone and computer, as well as the TOZO app.
--The charging case works great, and I love the LED power indicator. The case can be charged via USB or wirelessly. It’s also small and seems durable so far.
--Battery life has been excellent.
--They’re comfortable. And they stay securely in place, even during workouts.
--The sound is quite good. Very clear and rich.
--I’ve used them for both phone and video calls and have had no complaints– the dual mics with noise reduction perform admirably.
--The TOZO app allows you to adjust EQ settings for different genres and listening situations. Very cool.
--Lastly, you really can’t beat the price!
I’d highly recommend them."
"These T20 earbuds are the second Tozo earbuds I've purchased, and my fourth pair overall. As a value-conscious consumer, I've only purchased earbuds in the sub-$40 price range so far. Tozo T6s, Wyze Buds, Anker Soundcore P3i, and these Tozo T20s.

I've attached a few pictures of the outside of the box, the components when unboxing, and a picture of one of the pages of the user manual that comes with the earbuds describing the specs and the ""touch area"" for the controls (sorry about the crappy lighting).

The good:
*The price/value - This is very important to me.
*USB-C Charging - I really like my Tozo T6s, but the mini-USB on the bottom of the case was a pain. The T20s improve on that with a USB-C port on the back of the case.
*The battery / charge display on the case - Another point I really like is the display on the case. When flipping the lid up or down, the display on the case provides clear visual feedback on the state of battery for the case itself, as well as the each of the earbuds when they are charging the the case. The Tozo T6s have multiple LEDs on the case to indicate charge (good), but the Wyze and P3i's only have single LEDs to indicate if it's charging or not, but no clear way to know if it's 20%, 45%, 80%? I never knew how much I appreciated the T6 display until I tried the other earbuds and now the T20 display is EVEN BETTER.
*IPX6 rating - Granted, I haven't used these in the shower or underwater or out for my runs yet, but I do like that they're waterproof and sweatproof. I sweat a lot when I run so if, one: I can get these to stay in my ear, and two: they don't succumb to my sweat, I'll be happy.
*Mono listening - It's important to me that I can use the left, or right, or both earbuds. Often I only have one earbud in so I don't want earbuds that require you to keep both out of the case just to use them (Yes, some force you to do this. Why? I don't know)

The bad:
*Pause upon removal - All my other buds will autopause my media if I remove an earbud. These T20s don't. I hope that can be updated in the App or something, because I really like my podcasts to autopause when I have to pull my earbuds out because my wife or kids need my attention.
(Update 2023/09/24) - This seems to be intermittent. It didn't work on my computer, but it worked on my phone, which leads me to believe that the earbuds are designed for this, but the in/out-of-ear detection may just be a bit flawed.
*These earbuds are NOT for audiophiles. For my usage - YouTube, podcasts, some gaming, and music, these are fine. If you're capable of discerning that the 22Hz bass note is really supposed to be 24Hz in this song, then you probably need more fidelity than these sub $40 earbuds can provide.
*Form factor - I'm still partial to the Tozo T6s form. It's really just a personal preference. I've figured out that I prefer the earbuds without the kickstand that comes out of the ear.
*Touch area (see picture) - it's small, near the top of the buds, and doesn't really provide any tactile feedback that ""here's where to need to press"". Again, personal preference. I prefer the T6s or the P3i's (if you like the kickstand form factor) because the P3i's tactile area is basically anywhere on the whole kickstand part.

The OK / fine / ""this just 'is' "" features / operation:
*Bluetooth pairing & first use - I was able to pair these buds up to my computer without issue. Some of the other buds say ""Connecting"" or ""Pairing"" or make some unique startup sound upon first use or when they don't have a connection, but I didn't hear anything out of the T20s.
*Controls - I'm not sure if I can change the button presses in the Tozo App, some earbuds have that feature but I haven't downloaded the App yet. The volume, pause, and next/previous track controls do work as described in the included manual, though I noticed that on my computer that the Volume+ and Volume- were in increments of 5, i.e. once I paired them to my computer and set my volume to ""48"" in Windows, the Vol+ went to 53 then 58 then 63...same thing on the way back down. I did not have a chance to test the voice assistant or phone call controls yet.
*App - haven't tried it yet, but out of the box the earbuds work. Small tweaks / customizations I would make in the app would be changes to the actions for what button presses do, options to pause media when the earbuds are removed.
(Update 2023-09-24) - Not quite sure why the app is 80+MB, but it does have some sample music tracks, allows you to tweak the EQ on these T20s, and allows you to reconfigure the button presses. It prompts you to signup for a Tozo account, but it allows you to skip it as well. It is good that Tozo does NOT require an account to using the app, though it's clear from the UI design that a Tozo account is heavily encouraged.
*Dings - As I write this review, I have other media paused in the background. About every 10-15mins or so, the left earbuds is sending a chime. Yes, just the left one. I don't know if this is to indicate ""Hey, I'm still on, using battery, connected to your computer"" or a ""Disconnect/Reconnect"" event or what this chime means.

Things that I haven't really had a chance to test, but will report back if/when I do:
*Phone Audio Quality - I have a loud coworker that I take conference calls next to. When using the T6s, I get complaints from colleagues that they can hear him. I'm going to try these T20s to see if the microphone is better in background noise reduction.
*Noise cancelling - I wouldn't hang my hat on this feature. I'm sure it's there, but if you've ever had a chance to use legitimate noise cancelling headphones, these won't hold a candle to those. Generally though, if you size your ear tips correctly (Tozo provides a few different sizes with the buds), then they do a good job isolating noise.
*Battery Life - Not sure how long these will last, but if they're anything like the T6s, I'm pretty happy with how long the battery goes, and how quick it charges.

Would I recommend?
Yes! If you're looking for some functional earbuds that won't break the bank, I'd give these Tozo buds a chance to see if they're a fit for you."
"I already owned the Tozo T9 & the Tozo T6 when I ordered the Tozo T20. In my experience with Tozo, they're always worth the money, and then some. Why did I buy these? I do most of my music listening while lying on my side in bed. The T6 protrude way too far from the ear canal to ever be comfortable at all while doing this. The T9 protrude much less, but are still bulky enough to be quite uncomfortable lying on my side. The T20 are much smaller. They are the most comfortable pair of earbuds for side-lying that I've found. I wouldn't say they're exactly comfortable, but they're the best so far. I was also hoping that these would have more bass than the T9. They don't. I'd say they sound exactly like the T9, which isn't a bad thing. I've heard from Tozo customer support that their NC2 have better bass. They are about the same size as the T9, so I know they won't be as comfortable as the T20 for my needs, but I'm satisfied enough with Tozo & curious enough about the bass to give them a try. Every pair of buds I've tried that has excellent bass has been too uncomfortable for me to lie on my side with them in. If Tozo ever releases a pair with sufficient bass for my standards that fit like the T20, i'll buy them in bulk. I can't understand why people pay hundreds of dollars for earbuds that aren't as good as what Tozo gives you for a fraction of the price. Tozo is a brand that is inexpensive, sounds great, is well made, has an app with lots of options & has top-notch customer service. The T20 are comfortable for normal use & comfortable enough for lying on your side with them in your ears. They sound great, look great & cost far less than any brand out there that are worth buying. Btw, I owned a pair of Airpods Pro for a year while I briefly owned an iPhone. Tozo earbuds look better, sound better & cost around 10 times less. For Android at least, these are a much better option. If my phone's Bluetooth is turned on, all I do is open the Tozo case & the buds instantly pair. I recommend these to anyone, except maybe iPhone users who want options only Apple products can give you, and audiophiles, who will swear more expensive earbuds mean better earbuds.
Edit: I will say I can't necessarily recommend these for phone calls. When myy sister calls me, she says she can never hear me when I have these in. (Although I've used them for video calls without a hitch.)"
"5 stars due value, quality and utility. There are better earbuds out there, but for a whole lot more $$. These are my 3rd pair of Tozo earbuds (also T-1 and T-12 Pro) so that should say a lot.

It all started when I was looking to replace a broken pair of (big name) earbuds that I keep in my gym bag. I did a lot of research before buying my first pair of Tozo's, the T-12 Pro. Since then, I ordered the T-1 for my wife and the T-12 Pro's as my ""gym-workout"" pair. You really cannot go wrong if you're looking for an affordable pair of earbuds that will exceed your expectations for the money.

I picked the T-20's due to the number of good reviews & the price (on sale). I wanted a pair of earbuds to keep for when I am working out or cycling. For their intended purpose (to listen to music or video while exercising) they are great.

Sound: The T-20's exceed my needs and expectations. I can listen to music or watch a video while exercising. Sound reproduction is very good with noticeable highs and lows. The Tozo (mixer) App however appears to have -0- effect on mixing bass and treble (see update below, I got it to work). I find that I am better off using the Apple sound mixer on my IPhone. Overall, the sound is as good or better than the old earbuds that they replaced that were 5X more expensive.

Fit: No issues. Tozo also includes earbud pads in different sizes to fit your ears.

Features: Raise and lower volume, advance, stop or start music just by tapping R or L Bud.

Case: Love the digital battery level display on the carry case vs. my Apple earbuds where the battery charge % only appears on my I-Phone. This is a great feature that everyone should copy.

Taking calls: I d/n/k because I have yet to take a call while using the T-20's. I D/N/K if the Tozo will announce calls like my Apple Pro's.

Fit: They stay in my ears. Never once have the T-20s fell out (the Apple earbuds have on several occasions). I have had no connection issues, not noticed the weight of the buds. I would say that they are just fine.

Charging: I use cables so it's a non-issue for me. I do not use wireless or a charging stand. Recharging is fast.

Noise Canceling: Have yet to figure out how to activate. For now, the Apple NC on my Apple Pro's is the gold standard, even better than the Bose NC.

Overall: For the price ($30 +/- now on Amazon) how can you go wrong? You get a first-class pair of earbuds at a fraction of the cost of a ""big name"" manufacturer's buds. I recommend the Tozo T20's for anyone who wants a pair of earbuds that are affordable, comfortable, have a very good sound projection and a long battery life.

UPDATE:
Sound Mixer: I was finally able to figure out how to use the ""equalizer"" function in the app. The app works and works well.

Taking calls: I received a TC a few days ago. No, the Tozo's did not announce calls like the Apple Pro's, but I was able to determine that I had a call coming in. The call was clear and I experienced no issues."
":: Battery ::
Impressive! I've been using these ~2 hours per day for a week and the case is still showing 70% battery remaining, and that's from the initial change from opening the box. I have yet to plug these in.

:: Case ::
Really (aesthetically) slick and beautiful. The lid snaps shut with a pleasant *click* and the magnets ensure it doesn't open by accident. The battery life readout is pleasantly muted, but clear - not too bright while being easily readable. The case is also much more compact than other earbuds I've used, so they fit easily in my pocket.

:: Fit ::
Maybe I happen to have ears that perfectly accommodate the shape of these buds, but they're super comfortable. I use them primarily while running, which means I mostly have them in for 45-60 minutes at a time. They stay put very nicely, no need to occasionally push them in or adjust them. And no discomfort after wearing them for a long time. With other products, I'll get a dull ache after a while, which only gets worse with time - doesn't happen with these.

:: Sound ::
Admittedly, I'm not an audiophile, but I've got no qualms with the sound. The sound is at least as good as every other pair of earbuds I've used. The EQ provided with the Android app is fully customizable, which is nice. It also brings me to my sole complaint...

:: App ::
Why am I *required* to enable location settings... simply to adjust the EQ settings? This feels really invasive and unnecessary. Also, the app needs literally one single function - to adjust the sound. There's a Product tab, which shows more Tozo products. A Community tab? These are earbuds, it's not my whole life. I mean, there's no real downside to those extras, it just seems excessive. And yes, the location thing rubs me the wrong way.

:: TL;DR ::
Quality sound, amazing fit and battery life, adore the case, and would buy these again and again. The app is annoying, but not enough of a problem to ding a star."
"Ever since my first pair of t-10s(which still work flawlessly), I have only purchased tozos and recommended tozos to friends as they consistently beat every other headphone company for value, build quality, and customer support. These headphones are no exception to their consistency.

The T20 are very standard earbuds, with good sound quality, nice quality build and no extra bells and whistles. One thing i noticed, is this case has a display which shows earbuds charge % which is an awesome improvement I hope tozo keeps on all new products.

The sound quality is understandably less impressive than their ANC/higher priced lines but this is also a much more affordable product, so this is more for those looking for budget option, as tozo has many options in the higher price tiers.

As usual tozo includes different size ear tips for all ears and a USB c cable of good quality.

Highly recommend these earbuds if you're looking for very solid build quality, size, decent sound quality all for a great price. I expect these to last for a long time, as I have owned several pairs of tozos for years and only had them break when I ran them through the washer and dryer on accident."
"Review of Tozo T20 Earbuds: A Detailed Comparison with Tozo T12

I have had a pair of the T12 earbuds for nearly a year and love them, but I travel on long-haul flights often and wanted a better fit and longer battery life, so I am trying out the T20s. For those who don't want to read a long review, bottom line for me is that I prefer the sound of the T12s, but the fit of the T20s, so use the T20s for when I will be wearing them for several hours (like binge-watching movies on 15 hr flights) and when exercising (they stay in better), and will use the T12s when I want better sound for shorter periods.

The Tozo T20 earbuds and Tozo T12 earbuds represent two different generations in Tozo's line-up of affordable true wireless earbuds, offering a blend of features aimed at different user needs. Let’s dive into a comparison to help you understand how these two models stack up against each other.

Tozo T20 Earbuds:

The Tozo T20 earbuds are designed to offer a balanced mix of performance and comfort at a reasonable price. Here’s a breakdown of their features:

Design & Comfort: The T20s have a compact and ergonomic design, ensuring a snug fit for most ear shapes. They come with multiple sizes of ear tips to enhance comfort and achieve a good seal, which is crucial for passive noise isolation. For long flights (12+ hours), I found them more comfortable than the T12s and they stay in my ears better, so less time crawling around on the floor of the plane looking for dropped aer buds.

Sound Quality: These earbuds deliver a solid audio experience with balanced sound. They have a slightly enhanced bass which should please those who enjoy a bit of punch in their music, though they might not satisfy audiophiles looking for a more neutral sound profile.

Battery Life: The T20s provide about 8 hours of playback on a single charge - about 30% more than the T20s, with the case offering an additional 24 hours. This is quite competitive in the budget category and ensures you can get through a full day of use without worrying about running out of power.

Features: They support touch controls for playback, volume, and calls, which is a nice feature for convenience. They are also IPX8 rated for water resistance, making them suitable for workouts and light rain.

Connectivity: The T20s use Bluetooth 5.0, which provides a stable connection and better range compared to older Bluetooth versions. The pairing process is straightforward and reliable.

Tozo T12 Earbuds:

The Tozo T12 earbuds are a step up in terms of design and technology compared to the T20s. Here’s how they compare:

Design & Comfort: The T12s have a slightly bulkier design and while the fit is great, they are heavier, so are not as comfortable as the T20s after several hours and fall out of my ears more easily. They also come with various ear tip sizes, but the fit may not be as universally comfortable as the T20s for everyone.

Sound Quality: The T12s offer a more refined audio experience with a clearer sound and better separation between frequencies. They tend to provide a more detailed soundstage, which is a notable improvement over the T20s. The bass is still present but less overpowering, making them suitable for a wider range of music genres.

Battery Life: Battery life is comparable to the T20s, with around 6 hours per charge and an additional 24 hours from the case. While this is decent, it’s slightly less than the T20s, which may be a consideration for heavy users.

Features: The T12s also support touch controls and come with an IPX8 rating for water resistance. Additionally, they offer wireless charging capability for the case, which adds a level of convenience for tech enthusiasts.

Connectivity: Like the T20s, the T12s feature Bluetooth 5.0, ensuring good connectivity and range.

Comparison Summary:

Sound Quality: The T12s have a more detailed and refined sound compared to the T20s, making them better for those who prioritize audio quality.

Battery Life: The T20s edge out the T12s slightly in terms of battery longevity per charge, though both provide a similar total battery life when including the case.

Design & Comfort: Both models are comfortable, but the T20s may offer a more universally comfortable fit due to their slightly smaller size.

Features: The T12s offer the added convenience of wireless charging for the case, which the T20s lack.

In conclusion, if audio quality and wireless charging are your top priorities, the Tozo T12 earbuds would be the better choice. However, if you value a longer battery life and a snug fit, the Tozo T20 earbuds might be more suitable. Both models provide excellent value for their price, making them strong contenders in the budget true wireless earbud market."
"I’m going to preface this review by saying that this is the first Tozo review I’ve written, primarily because I couldn’t find a helpful review, video, or blog post about the T20s anywhere when I was researching before I purchased. Full disclaimer, Tozo is my favorite “budget” earbud brand. And no, I was not paid to post this review and or given anything for free in exchange for my review (if my rating didn’t give that away).

This is going to be a very long review, so tldr; the fit is good, the sound is phenomenal, but making phone calls was unsuccessful outside of a completely silent environment. If you don’t want ANC and don’t need to make phone calls, the T20s pack some truly “best in class” features.

To start, I wasn’t kidding when I said Tozo is my favorite “budget” brand of earbuds. I own T9s (my “daily” drivers), T10s (my go-to gym buds), T12s (primarily for travel - they are SUPER comfortable), and a pair of NC2’s. I was gifted the NC2’s by a family member after they heard me rave about the brand so often, but all other pairs I purchased for under $50 each, and probably closer to between $30-40/pair, hence the “budget” reference. The T20s are the first pair of Tozo buds I’ve spent more than $50 on, and the most I’ve spent on a Tozo product to date. At this price point, I feel like being critical is justified.

Let’s start with the pros:

- Sound. One word: outstanding. I seriously can’t believe how good these sound for under $100. I would put them up against my wife’s Beats Studio Buds or my old pair of AirPod Pros (1st Gen) any day. If I had to find something to be critical about here, I’d say the bass could be a bit deeper (the T10s have awesome bass, by comparison, and Beats are obviously best-in-class in this area), but honestly, they still win out over those 1st gen AirPod Pros.

- Comfort. I’m going to put this in the Pros, but overall I’d say they’re only slightly above average here. They feel good enough to be a daily driver, but I’d say they’re still pretty comparable to the fit of the much cheaper T9s. By comparison, the T12s are the most comfortable buds I’ve ever owned. These T20s are obviously a different style than the T12s, so I’d expect them to fit differently, but they aren’t constantly falling out of my ears like similarly designed buds from other brands, so that’s a win.

- The case. I could write an entire chapter about how much I love this case. The size is convenient, the weight and finish have a premium feel, the display is clear (and from what I can tell, accurate), the lid closes securely and isn’t even the slightest bit flimsy, wireless charging works flawlessly, the design choice to put the usb-c port on the back of the case instead of the bottom like so many others is a stroke of genius, the buds are very easy to remove and replace, and the ability for the case to stand upright on its own is the bow on top. I will note that somehow my case came with some kind of dent or scratch on it, but since I can’t say for sure that it left the factory like that and I love everything else functionally and aesthetically so much, I can’t ding these earbuds for that.

- Battery Life. Again, I’ll put this in the Pros, but I’d still say it’s probably about average overall. The battery life is rated to be about the same as the NC2s, but I honestly rarely use those as I find that I probably get closer to 6hrs per charge instead of the 10hrs advertised. I haven’t let the T20s completely run out of battery, but I’ve run them multiple times for at least 8 hours out of the case listening to music, podcasts, and watching videos (I’ll be discussing calls in the next section), so I’m confident saying that the battery life advertised is accurate.

- Gestures. Gestures work flawlessly; they are even borderline too sensitive. I much prefer the increased sensitivity to a lack of it, and definitely prefer the sensor over the physical buttons on the T10s. I often find myself accidentally pausing music when adjusting the earbuds, even when I’m very careful about where I touch, so some people might see this as more of a con.

Moving on to the Cons:

- Connectivity. This seems primarily dependent on what I’m connected to. When I connect to my MacBook, I never have issues with connectivity. When I’m connected to my iPhone 14 Pro, I run into *fairly* frequent issues where I get either feedback of some sort (usually brief static) or one or both earbuds will quickly skip in and out. This seems to happen whether my phone is in my hand or sitting 2 feet away on my desk. At first I wanted to blame my phone, especially since this doesn’t seem to happen with my MacBook, but this doesn’t happen with any other buds I own, Tozo or otherwise. It’s probably something minor that a future firmware update will fix.

- Range. I can’t say that the range of these earbuds is any worse than the other Tozos I own (I can maybe get about 10ft from my phone before I start to lose connection), but at nearly double the price point of the other buds, I’d have to say this is a negative. $50+ earbuds should just have bette range, IMO. This is one area where even my old 1st Gen AirPod Pros excelled. With those AirPods, I remember once driving away from my house and I probably got at least 20 yards (maybe more) from my house before I lost connection and realized I had left my phone at home.

- Phone Calls. Phone calls are the MAIN reason for my overall 2* rating. If these buds had better phone calls, these would be at least 4* buds, and possibly even 5* with a future firmware update fixing the connection stability. Phone calls are an absolute necessity for me, and the experience making calls with the T20s has been so poor that I consider them almost unusable. The voice on the other end comes through crystal clear, but apparently I am so hard to hear in an environment that’s not “library silent” that I literally can’t take phone calls anywhere outside of my home office. Whether I’m in the car or somewhere with even more background noise like a grocery store, or even worse, the gym, I’m constantly being asked to repeat myself or told to “just call back later when I’m not busy.” It’s become such an inconvenience that I’ve had to stop using the T20s altogether despite all of their otherwise great qualities. To make matters worse, even Siri and Alexa are constantly asking me to repeat myself, or making some completely unrelated action or comment, when I activate the voice control function. Maybe this can be fixed with a firmware update as well, but there’s clearly something wrong with the microphone out of the box.

Honorable mentions:

- The Tozo App. I’m sure the app is great, but the sound is so good out of the box, I really don’t think it’s needed. If you’re more of an audiophile than I am, or prefer different genres of music (I’m a self-proclaimed metal head), you might get more use out of it than I did. It offers a wide array of default sound profiles, as well as the ability to customize your own. I also like that it shows the current battery life and you can use it to easily update the firmware when needed. It’s also completely free.

- IPX8. I didn’t test this, but IPX8 (true waterproof) with this style bud is pretty awesome.

- Active Noise Cancelling (ANC). No, these are not noise canceling earbuds. In my experience, noise cancelling is great when it works, but just nukes the battery. These buds fit snugly and securely enough in my ears that I really don’t miss the ANC. This is personal preference, of course, so your mileage may vary.

To summarize: the problems with phone calls were a deal breaker for me, but if you’re not going to use the T20s for calls and have a budget between $50-100, these are, hands-down, the best earbuds I’ve tried in this price range with a few small caveats mentioned above. Sound quality, physical build quality, and comfort are stand out features.

If you’re like me, you’ve researched and compared every earbud in this price range you can find. Also, if you’re like me, you were frustrated when you couldn’t find a single review, YouTube video, or Reddit post that even mentions the T20s let alone actually reviews them (at least at the time of writing). If you’ve made it this far, hopefully you got something useful out of this review. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk."
"Tozo T20 Earbuds Review

The Tozo T20 wireless earbuds offer a solid balance of sound quality, comfort, and affordability. Right out of the box, they have a sleek and compact design, and the charging case is small enough to fit in a pocket, making it super portable.

Sound Quality:

The sound profile is well-rounded with a strong emphasis on bass, which is great for those who enjoy a bass-heavy listening experience. The mids and highs are clear, though they don’t shine as much as the bass. For casual listeners, the sound is satisfying, but audiophiles might notice a slight lack of depth in the upper range.

Comfort & Fit:

The earbuds come with multiple ear tips, allowing you to find a comfortable fit. They stay snug even during workouts, which is a major plus. However, the fit might feel a bit tight during extended use for some people.

Battery Life:

The battery life is impressive, lasting up to 6 hours on a single charge, with the case providing an additional 24 hours of charge. It’s enough to get through a full day without worrying about constantly charging them.

Connectivity:

Pairing is seamless and quick with Bluetooth 5.0. They maintain a stable connection even at a reasonable distance from the source device. The touch controls are responsive, though they might take some getting used to.

Water Resistance:

With an IPX8 rating, the T20s are great for workouts or even light rain, providing peace of mind for those who lead active lifestyles.

Overall:

For the price point, the Tozo T20 offers a great listening experience with decent sound quality, reliable battery life, and excellent portability. They’re ideal for anyone looking for budget-friendly wireless earbuds without sacrificing too much in terms of performance."
"I've had Tozo's T8s, T12s, and Crystal buds. All have been pretty good. I picked these up when my Crystals got lost in a move.

Pros:
- Price -- on sale these are a steal

- Connect easily, rarely lose connection even if I leave my phone in one place and wander the apartment with them in

- Solid sound, comparable to the Crystals and very customizable through the app. Slightly larger drivers than the Crystals, and I feel this reflects in their ability to deliver bass. The default tuning is a little heavy on the treble for my taste, but it's a nice change of pace from other cheap earbuds that overtune the bass into muddiness.

- Good fit achievable with the wide range of included eartip sizes (they even color matched them -- the red buds get pinkish tips, etc)

- Availability of bright colors makes it easier to find the earbuds in my house of all black items

- Wireless charging works perfectly, though only with phone wireless chargers (won't work on the earbuds/watch half of a double Samsung wireless charger for example, but works on the phone side)

-Solid battery life (6-8 hours before needing to recharge the buds in the case)

- LED display is great as always

Cons:
- The overall look is cheesier and cheaper than the Crystal buds with their slick clear/black case -- the case is giving McDonalds Toy plastic a bit with its light, thin, matte plastic

- Sensitive touch controls that are easy to trigger when adjusting, though I get around this by handling them primarily by the stems

- Not as slick a form factor as the Crystals -- less comfortable for wearing to sleep as they stick out a bit more, but some people will prefer the Airpods-esque stem design

Overall, Tozo continues to make the best budget wireless earbuds."
"I was on the hunt for a pair of waterproof earbuds, specifically with an IPX8 rating, since my Apple AirPods aren’t waterproof. The TOZO T20 caught my attention, and I couldn’t be happier with my decision. For just $20 after the $10 coupon, these are by far the best value earbuds I’ve come across.

The sound quality blew me away—surprisingly, they sound even better than my AirPods Pro 2nd gen! I didn’t expect that at all, but the 10mm drivers deliver deep, rich sound that’s hard to believe at this price point. Bass is punchy, and the clarity across all frequencies is excellent.

Another bonus is the TOZO app. It’s a great feature that most other budget brands don’t even offer. The app allows you to customize sound settings and more, which is such a nice touch at this price level.

I noticed some reviews mentioning an issue with water activating the touch controls, but there’s a simple fix for that: just download the TOZO app and turn off the touch controls. Problem solved!

If you’re looking for affordable, waterproof earbuds with amazing sound and features, these are it. Highly recommend!"
"Grape tomato and goldfish snack for size comparison. :)

We have a lot of Tozo products for all my devices. We currently have 2 of their chargers, 1 around the head headphones, and 6 ear buds. I like them all for different reasons. Here's my pro/con list for these.

Pros:

⭐️ Comfortable and surprisingly interchangeable. Seems like they shouldn’t be, but technically I can put the right ear in my left ear and barely feel a difference. This is a huge plus for me!
⭐️ I LOVE that I can see the charge level on the outside for both the case and the headphones. This is an amazing upgrade!
⭐️ The color is wonderful. I went with the darker blue.
⭐️ The case stands upright. Seems silly, but the one I have that doesn’t bothers me.
⭐️ Of course the sound quality is top notch, loud, and I can barely hear a thing if I have two in at normal volume. They’re definitely noise canceling.

Cons:

⭐️ I have to put the right side in the right side to charge. If I have both out, it takes me a second to figure out which one goes where when my brain is tired.

That’s it! Shortest cons list I’ve ever made for a review."
"I previously had the TOZO T9 earbuds and liked them quite a bit. I had one earbud go bad on me so I bought the newer T20. While these are good earbuds, I have an ongoing issue with the Bluetooth connection with these and my Pixel 8 Pro (same issue with the Galaxy S21 Ultra). The issue I have is that the audio will randomly become unintelligible. If I handle the phone the issue will clear up. So there is some sort of reception issue. I did not have this issue with the T9 on the same phones. Likewise, no issue with my Bose QC headphones. Maybe I just got a bad one. I still use these every day. I just know that if the audio goes wonky I need to take my phone out of my pocket.

I really like the charge % being visible on the case. That is a nice touch. The case uses USB-C to charge and it charges quickly. The package includes several size cushions for the earbuds so you can get the right fit.

So I am disappointed with the Bluetooth issue, but it is not a deal breaker and next time I need earbuds I will again consider TOZO devices."
"I was shopping around for new earbuds and looked at several brands. Including the big brand names. After reading the positive reviews and seeing that there was a promotion going on, I decided to try these out. I was already familiar with the brand because I had bought some wireless headphones before and was satisfied with those, so I was hopeful.

At first, I had an issue with the right one turning on and syncing but it could have been user mistake. After a few tries I got it work and got it synced to my phone. Sound quality is pretty good and noise cancellation is pretty good as well. The BIGGEST issue is the battery life. (Considering they promote long battery life on these) My picture shows the case charged at 95%, three minutes before it was at 100%. To me that seems like a big jump is just a few minutes. Also, the earbuds went from 100% to 67% in about 30mins of use. I’ll continue to give these a try for a few more days before deciding if I need to return them.

I really want to like these. Will update at a later time."
"After researching multiple earbuds from cheap to expensive I settled on the Tozo T20 in blue. I just received them and have only been listening for a few minutes, but so far they have been excellent. Sound quality is fantastic. I love the wireless charging and ease of checking the charge status. While not active noise cancelling, they do suppress a lot of noise with the ear bud design and silicone tips.

I have some expensive Sony wireless over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones and multiple types of apple wired headphones, but I was looking for a wireless, affordable option for when wires get in the way and you need in the ear (like when working out/running).

Many family members recommended Tozo to me and I see why. My wife has the A1, my brother has the T20, and my sister in law has another model (not sure which one) that she has had for multiple years with no issue. I tried my wife’s A1 ear buds and they impressed me, but I wanted stems and the added features of the T20.

Fit is good and these seem like they will be great for use while working out or performing other activities. So far this appears to be a great product and I have no complaints, especially for the price point. I am looking forward to trying the app for EQ settings, but have not tried it yet."
"The Tozo T20 Airbuds offer a commendable balance of performance and affordability. Featuring a sleek design, these earbuds are comfortable and fit securely, making them suitable for extended use. They provide good sound quality with a clear, balanced audio profile and decent bass, though they may lack the depth found in higher-end models.

One of their standout features is the IPX8 waterproof rating, which ensures they can withstand sweat and rain, making them ideal for workouts and outdoor activities. The battery life is impressive, offering up to 6 hours of playtime on a single charge, with the charging case extending this to around 24 hours.

Connectivity is solid, with Bluetooth 5.0 ensuring a stable connection and quick pairing with devices. However, some users may find the touch controls a bit finicky, and the lack of noise-cancellation can be a downside in noisy environments.

Overall, the Tozo T20 Airbuds provide excellent value for money, especially for those looking for reliable, budget-friendly earbuds with good sound quality and durability."
"At first, I thought these were a lot like the @pple pods, but I was really impressed by the performance.
I was able to listen on either phone without worry, I used these for numerous activities around the house, and with decent distance from the phone with no problem.
I picked them up with the TOZO wireless charging pad, and they charge wirelessly too. that surprised me, but maybe I missed it in the description.
The sound is pretty good, and unlike older Tozo buds I've tried, the buds don't continuously discharge on me. Because of this, I kept them in pocket for a week without use (intentional) and still had 90+ percent charge on buds and case when checked.
Thought I'd give these to the kid, but I'm second guessing myself."
"One thing that has solidified my love of TOZO brand earphones is the fact their app has equalizer features, customization of the touch controls and it is all in a compact and comfortable package. Set up and connecting is easy. The software is upgradable. These rival big name brands that I’ve bought and I may honestly like them more than my AirPods Pro or Skullcandy Sesh ANC. The battery life blows other manufacturers earbuds away. The color I got just makes me happy. The only thing that would make these better is if like the TOZO T10 they had a built in lanyard hole and lanyard. I started with the T10 and then I found TOZO HT2 and had to have those because I don’t always want in ear headphones. My point is, I have became a huge fan and fast. These T20 will be my work and daily carry pair. The calls using them, the person on the other end told me sounded great and clear. Tiny thing to mention that made me happy, the silicone earbud replacement tips are marked/embossed with the size on each silicone tip.(not sure if you’ll be able to see but I did add a photo to demonstrate the size range and their markings) There’s not guessing that you’ve made a proper set. They come default with the Medium tips on. The tips are XXL-XS that’s a fantastic range and ensures that you will find your perfect fit. Thank you TOZO for making affordable headphones with premium features!"
"I used to have the TOZOs T21 and T6, and I can say without a doubt that the T20s are my favorite! The design is sleek and color-customizable, which I extremely like. The main difference between the T20 and T21 is the use of rubber tips — which the T20 has. Since the packaging comes with multiple rubber tip sizes, I was able to adjust the T20s to my preference, which the T21s don't offer.

The battery life and sound quality are excellent with all TOZO products that I have purchased, and the T20s are no exception. I was able to use the earbuds for at least 6 hours until they needed to recharge in their case, and the case lasted for about 4-5 full charges. The functionality of the T20s are roughly the same as their other earbuds - you can tap to pause, increase and decrease volume, or switch between songs, podcasts, and Tiktok videos (if you adjust your Settings). There is also a separate TOZO app that allows me to easily make adjustments to the functionality of the T20s (ie: if I want to change double taps from skipping a song to some other feature).

I highly also recommend purchasing the separate W2 chargers from TOZO — I got them in a bundle and absolutely love being able to wirelessly recharge the T20 case and my phone. There is also a current 50% off sale, alongside a 20% off coupon, which definitely makes the T20s a great bang for your buck :)"
"I wasn't convinced that I would enjoy and appreciate as much as I do, these T-20 earbuds. The price told me they couldn't be as good as more expensive options. But, because of the price, I couldn't resist.

I received the earbuds in good order, the packaging was effective and easy enough to get into. Pairing and connecting have been a breeze. The fact that I can charge the storage case and keep the earbuds fully charged while away from AC power is great feature.

Like all touch sensitive earbuds, I had to get comfortable with inserting and rearranging the buds, but I expected that.

Overall, this purchase was definitely 5 stars. I recommend these earbuds to anyone that is looking for a quality, easy-to-use piece of gear that delivers very good sound."
"I’m coming from Apple AirPods Pro. The left earbud is making a screeching noise every time I put it on. Needless to say, after spending 200$ on pair of earphones, I’m not spending the same. The AirPods did last close to 4 and half year. I decided to try the Tozo T20 earbuds.
It’s been a month I’ve been using this pair. Here is a short review -

Pros
1. Price - I got these for 30$
2. Connectivity - quickly connects to my iPhone
3. Easy charging

Cons
Sound quality is average. I mean you can’t get it any better for 30$ I guess.

If this one lasts for even half the life of my AirPods, I’m more than happy. I’ll update this post if something goes wrong with this one."
"I ordered the T20's for my wife last month to replace a different set that went through the wash a few times. These are supposed to be more water resistant, and are a good bit better quality than the ones she had, clear audio and the microphones have passable noice detection. She just pointed out to me that despite using both earbuds together for hours at a time, she's only had to charge the case for the first time this past Monday amd its still at 85% nearly a week later!
If you need a decent set of earbuds, that'll keep going for weeks at a time, seems you can't go wrong with the T20's."
"Ok let's start with it's tozo so they have a wide range of products , if you wa t premium go for the golden x1 fron tozo

If you are on a budget then these are probably there best budget friendly in the line up and I would personally say the most comfortable for the price too

Comes with a charging case with indicator in numbers which is extremely helpful

The sound is mid range

Not super heavy base but it's there enough to not miss it .
Highs are lacking which is expected at this price range

But for cheap do what you need and better then other competitors at the price then I would say give these a go"
"I use these earbuds every day, and the sound quality is excellent. However, due to the structure of my ear canals, I can't wear them for long periods—more than an hour and I start to feel uncomfortable. After switching to the smaller ear tips they provided, the discomfort improved by about 30% to 50%, and they don't fall out easily. Although the actual battery life isn't as long as advertised, unless you use them at a lower volume (around 25%), they still last quite a while, so I charge them about once or twice a week. I recommend them for anyone looking for budget-friendly earbuds that offer great value and quality."
"I recently picked up the TOZO T20 earbuds and am genuinely impressed. For their price point, these earbuds offer exceptional value and performance that rivals more expensive options. Some of the key features I noticed were better than some earbuds I had previously used.

Comfort and Fit: The TOZO T20 earbuds come in multiple sizes and have ear tips that ensure a comfortable and secure fit. They're lightweight and ergonomic, making them perfect for extended listening sessions. Whether I'm working out or just lounging at home, they stay in place and never cause discomfort.
Sound Quality: The sound quality is remarkable, with rich bass, crisp highs, and a balanced midrange that brings your music to life. Whether listening to my favorite playlists or catching up on podcasts, the TOZO T20 delivers clear, immersive audio. The soundstage feels broad and dynamic, making for an engaging listening experience.
Ease of Use: Pairing them with my devices was seamless, and the controls were intuitive. The touch-sensitive controls are responsive and allow me to easily manage my music and calls without fumbling with my phone.
Additional Features: The TOZO T20 also offers good passive noise isolation, which is great for focusing in noisy environments. While it doesn't have active noise cancellation, it does a commendable job of minimizing external distractions.
Overall, if you're looking for high-quality earbuds without breaking the bank, these are worth considering. I highly recommend them!"
"I really like these earbuds is the sound quality. I listen to a wide variety of music and enjoy listening with the TOZO T20 earbuds. The batters life is as advertised, outstanding.

The problem I had is getting the black earbuds to pair with my
Apple iPad. While they paired right up with my iPhone. It wasn’t until I looked at the comparison chart of all the different colors of the T20 I noticed that the black does not have bluetooth, while the other colors do have Bluetooth.

This was not discovered until it was too late to return them. So if you want the TOZO T20 to work across multiple devices; such as in my case an iPhone and iPad purchase one of the other colors.

For the price you will not be disappointed with the T20 sound quality and the battery life."
"I've been using the Tozo T20 True Wireless Stereo Earbuds for a week now, and I'm thoroughly impressed. The sound quality is simply fantastic, with deep bass and crystal-clear highs that are a delight. .

One of the standout features for me is the comfortable fit. These lightweight earbuds come with multiple ear tip sizes, so it was easy to find the perfect fit for my ears. They stay securely in place and I barely notice them.

The battery life is excellent as well. I can easily get through a full day of use without needing to recharge, and the charging case is compact and convenient to carry around. The touch controls are intuitive and responsive.

Overall, the Tozo T20 Earbuds offer outstanding value for the price. They deliver premium sound quality, a comfortable fit, and reliable performance. Highly recommended."
"I've been using the TOZO T20 Wireless Earbuds and I'm thoroughly impressed with their performance and features. The 10mm speakers with large dynamic drivers deliver impressive stereo sound. The bass is particularly good, and the overall sound is full and vivid.

With a full 13 hours of playtime on a single charge and 48.5 hours total with the case, these earbuds provide excellent play time.

Waterproof rating of IPX8 rating means I can use them during workouts or in a light rain.

The ergonomic design and 6 different ear tip sizes ensure a comfortable and a secure fit.

The TOZO App provides the ability to customize EQ settings and is a great feature for personalizing the sound.

Dual Mic ENC ensures call quality is clear, with effective noise reduction during conversations.

Charging Options include both wireless and USB-C charging.

An LED display on the case is a handy feature."
"I’ve been using these almost daily for the past 8 months and have nothing but good things to say about them. The sound quality, battery life, charging speed and fit all were well above my expectations.

No trouble keeping them in my ears with a comfortable fit. I wear them 5-6 hours a day comfortably. Easy to use controls that I can even use my forearm when unable to use my hands.

They have a great sound and if you put the Tozo app on your phone, you can adjust the range of sound to your preference. It works wonderfully in loud areas. I operate loud machines working under locomotives and have the volume set at the highest recommended. Still has more volume available to raise it and I can hear clearly.

They charge up quickly when placed in the charger. The case shows you how much charge it has and has charging indicators for the earbuds that also show their battery level. The Tozo app gives you an exact battery percentage. The case charges fairly quickly as well.

I wouldn’t hesitate to buy these again. For the price, you’ll be extremely happy with them."
"This is my first pair of nonconnected wireless earbuds. I considered various Apple air pods in the past but avoided them because of the poor fit of standard Apple earbuds, and the probability of clumsily losing one of them the first week of ownership.

The TOZO T20 has been a very pleasant surprise. The earbuds are fairly low profile, comfortable, and stay in my ears. I use them mostly at night in bed but would feel comfortable working out with these in my ears. I mostly listen to podcasts and audiobooks, am not an audiophile, but suspect that most users would find these reasonable for music. I haven't used them for phone calls and therefore can't comment on the mike. After only a month of ownership I can't comment on durability, thus only a four-star rating. They hold a charge as advertised and can be recharged several times by the case. So far, I'm delighted with these. They are a bargain in $25 to $30 price range."
"I recently purchased this product, and I am thoroughly impressed! The product exceeded my expectations in every way. The quality is outstanding, and it works exactly as described.

One of the best features is [specific feature], which has made a significant difference in [how it improved your experience]. It’s clear that a lot of thought went into the design and functionality of this product.

This product is also very user-friendly and easy to set up, even for someone who isn’t very tech-savvy. The instructions were clear, and everything worked seamlessly from the start.

In terms of value for money, this product is definitely worth every penny. It’s durable, well-made, and performs better than similar products I’ve tried in the past.

I would highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for [type of product]. It’s a top-notch product that delivers on its promises."
"I've tried several products from the Tozo brand, and among them, these headphones truly stand out for the following reasons:

Impressive battery life: The battery lasts incredibly long; I've had to charge them very few times, and I'm genuinely impressed by their battery life, with over 25 hours of continuous use. Additionally, the case displays the remaining battery percentages, which, although a small detail, significantly enhances the user experience.

Effective noise cancellation: The noise cancellation really works, even in noisy environments. This is especially noticeable in gyms, where loud music and conversations can be distracting. With the noise cancellation, I can focus on the music I want to hear and concentrate better on my workout.

Water-resistant: With an IPX8 rating, these headphones are perfect for people who sweat a lot. Sometimes, headphones slip or fall due to sweat, but this model doesn't have that issue, as the aerodynamic design prevents any movement.

In summary, these headphones are an excellent choice for users who want to immerse themselves in sound, whether for listening to music or making calls. They have exceptional battery life and offer clear, concise sound. I highly recommend them for any activity."
"Overall:
- Would highly recommend and would certainly purchase again. Very comfortable, great fit, fantastic sound out-of-box.

Pros:
- Product packaging includes 6 pairs of different-sized silicone earpieces.
- Earplug and case construction is solid. Not fancy or cheap.
- Comfortable and secure fit
- Out-of-box sound is exceptional at this price point. Bass is punchy, mids are scooped and don't sound muddy, and the high's are clear. You can download the free TOZO app to perform firmware updates and adjust EQ settings, but after comparing them to my studio monitor headphones, I elected to leave the TOZO T20's on the Standard EQ preset in the TOZO app. (For those interested, I achieve a flat frequency response on my studio monitor headphones by using the SonarWorks SoundID Reference app on my computer. This lets me compare the TOZO earbuds against the flat EQ of my headphones.)

Cons:
- Charging cable is short (less than 1ft)
- More color options, maybe? ...but even that said, just buy the earbuds. They're great!"
"I think Tozo products provide the best value on the market. The T20 earbuds are great. They provide exceptional sound quality, long battery life and are very comfortable even when worn for long periods of time.

I frequently travel cross country and have tried other earbuds to not only help pass the time but cut down on the noise. The T20 far surpasses other models I have tried. The battery life easily takes me coast to coast then, when necessary, quickly charge for another trip. One of the best feature for me is if I misplace them while traveling, I can easily replace them for a very reasonable price. I highly recommend the T20!"
"The sound quality is amazing! I originally bought these for work under my earmuffs, but I'd use these over my old headphones at home. I love the long battery life, and how it immediately connects to your bluetooth when you put them in. My wife's hates earbuds due to her having small ear canals. She tried these out and loves them! They are very functional and you can't beat the price. I would never spend over $50 on a pair of headphones, I'm so happy with the quality of this product."
"I've used Tozo earphones for a couple of years now and have been very happy with my experience each time, and these were no different. Sound quality, for the price you're paying, is very decent, with a healthy midrange and comparable bass. The charging case with specific charge percentage was a nice feature, it's hard to go back to another bud case after that.

I don't have extensive experience with many other products in this price range; the only competitor I've had a chance to use is JBL's wireless noise-cancelling earbud, and those are easily outclassed by the T20. The only letdown I've had with this model, compared to prior Tozo buds that I've owned, is the lack of an ""active"" noise-cancelling feature. These seem to have passive noise-cancelling, but I don't quite understand why they removed the active cancelling that existed in previous models of this bud. That's my only gripe, but the passive cancelling is still passable."
"My left earbud stopped functioning shortly after the return by date given after purchase. I reached out to TOZO after trying all of their troubleshooting steps and after providing a few details about my order, TOZO was able to resolve my issue. They replaced my order with a new set of earbuds. I'm satisfied with this resolution because they are a great pair of earbuds. Loud sound/Bass, no problems ever connecting to Bluetooth and I love the fact this pair can be charged wirelessly.
Good investment here imo. 😊"
"These are nice enough, but they aren't pass through and you won't be able to hear what's going on around you which was what I was hoping for with the headphones. That, and they seem to collect a lot of background data which is kind of weird and need your location or have the option to record your location which is weird and a bit unsettling, but you do have the option to keep it off"
"Headphones are amazing! They beat anything else in the price range and are just as good as air pods. I have tiny ear canals and the extra size ear plug part is the only reason these fit me. Being able to see the battery life of not only the charging case but the headphones too is huge, no more guessing when to charge them, no more dead headphones. Overall 8/10 cannot be beat at this price"
"Even though these lasted less than a year I was impressed by the customer service when I had told them that my earbuds no longer paired via Bluetooth and did multiple troubleshooting steps to ensure that it was useless.

I contacted them on their official website on 08/16 and received my replacement on 08/20.

I got introduced to the Tozo brand my someone gifting me the Tozo 10 and the Tozo 20 is definitely an upgrade. I appreciate their one year warranty when the error was outside of my return window and purchase protection from AMEX.

Thank you Tozo I appreciate the replacement!"
"Comfortable, Reliable, and Long-Lasting
I've been thoroughly impressed with my new earbuds. The fit is incredibly comfortable, and they stay securely in place even during workouts. The sound quality is crisp and clear, and I've had no issues with connectivity.

The feature I appreciate most is the long battery life. I can easily get through a full day of use without needing to recharge. Additionally, the percentage-based battery indicator is a nice touch, as it gives me a more precise idea of how much charge is left.

Overall, I'm highly satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend these earbuds to others."
"I had a new pair that I accidentally left in the pocket of my scrub top and threw the top in the wash. Darn! Of course neither bud worked when fresh out of the wash. With nothing to lose, I threw the buds back in my pocket and ran them through 3 or four drying cycles. What do you know, they started working again! I still use them today. Not sure my delicate expensive Apple ear buds would be quite so tenacious. Definitely five stars."
"The TOZO T20 Wireless Earbuds are an excellent choice for anyone seeking great sound quality. The bass is impressive, giving a rich and full audio experience, and they’re easy to connect right out of the box. The TOZO app allows for easy adjustments to suit your preferences, making it simple to fine-tune the sound. With 48.5 hours of playtime and an LED digital display to keep track of battery life, these earbuds are perfect for long listening sessions. Plus, their IPX8 waterproof rating adds peace of mind. To top it off, TOZO's customer service is friendly and responsive, making the whole experience even better."
"Great purchase. I love the convenience of this product, once I got it to sync with my phone it was ready to be used. I often have issues with the fit of earbuds, but these worked right away and stayed in place. A bunch of ear tips sets are part of the package placement sets for different ear sizes. 
I have not run with them, but used them in the gym, for business calls and casual listening. The sound is clear and crisp, the microphone is very good and sensitive. The noise cancelling especially during calls is fantastic. The battery life is very long. I have used them for about one hour every day and haven’t had to charge them yet after 2 weeks in."
So in 2021 I bought the t6 earbuds and have worn them every day all day since and loved the sound. Recently they started to mess up so I decided to buy tozo again. Saw these and liked the app part but was pensive about the sound quality since the t10 ones my dad had were kind of lacking in sound quality far ass bass goes but I decided to give them a shot. Right out of the box I set them up using the equalizer in the app for bass+ because I like bass in my music. Man I have to say the sound quality for music with that setup is unbelievably nice. My old lady even asked for a pair because she loves the fit and the sound. Because I wear 1 at work always I am ordering some memory foam replacement tips so they won’t fall out while I’m sweating at work. Or should I say the gym since my job works me out like the gym. Far as battery life and other stuff we shall see how that goes. Right now I’m tired from work and going to relax and watch a movie on my phone and see how they sound for that.
A quality set of earbuds for everyday listening for the price. Fit and comfort is great and provides enough of a seal to keep most outside distractions at bay even though they are not a noise canceling set. I find the sound quality better than the previous T12s I have owned and they seem to be clearer on calls for others as well. Tozo customer service is quick to respond through the Tozu app. Very satisfied with their products and support.
"A nicely designed product by Tozo. Unlike the T6 or the A1, this T20 earbud is shaped a little bit like the Airpod. It curves on the main piece and has a long stem. The earbud fits snugly on my ear and it does not seem that it would fall off very easily. The package comes with a charging case, a short USB-A to USB-C cable (a little more than 6 in), and 5 pairs of additional different sizes of rubber pieces. The USB-C goes to the back of the case for charging. The charging case has an LED light showing the battery life and charging indicator.

Overall I think this is a great product for those who look for affordable, good quality of earbud. When I purchase it, there was also a $6 coupon that you can pick before checking out."
"I have been using Tozo for a few years now, and so far I've been quite impressed. Especially with the T20 series.
I appreciate how durable they are, and I like the indicator on the charger. I knowing its a small detail but it's nice to see an accurate indicator that tells me how long my ear buds will last.
If I had a gripe though, it's that the bass isn't as prominent on many songs. Like it's fine, as if your listening to a standard car sound system without touching the equalizer. But besides that, I love it."
"1 is higher then the other, 1 of my ear-holes are bigger then the other, each inner shape is unique so I've always struggled with fit.

These for perfect! I wore 1 for 8 hours straight today with no ear fatigue and actually forgetting I had then in.
I can't fit apple ear Buds they always fall out of me ear. These feel so secure when in!
The sound is TOZO at its best with customized equalizer settings in the app.
Headphone makers also usually make you pick from 1 of 2 colors, usually black or white... but I purchased mine in red and they look luxurious.
The cherry on top (red reference) is the digital screen that shows you battery percentage and more sprinkles= wireless charging! Tozo T20 are great!"
"I previously went with a pair of JBLs and after, I believe it was, 2 weeks the battery would no longer hold a charge. I just saw them and previously had a jbl speaker that did ok but returned those and saw these. The charge on these is insanely good. I only use them every other day for about 2 hours but the case charge is just now at 50%. They fit particularly well in the ear too, the pivot of the sound bud into the ear gives a great fit and no discomfort. I'm very happy with these"
"I love these! I must have 10 or 12 sets of BT earbuds. All ‘inexpensive’….while I do have an Iphone, iPad & Apple Watch, I’m not spending hundreds on earbuds. So I watch the specials on Amazon and I’ve stumbled on some excellent buds & excellent sellers! These sound great, feel great, etc.
These are so comfy, I forget I have them in, like, I’ll leave my apt, go down the elevator, they’ll d/c and then reconnect when I walk back in my apt. I had been looking for something I could sleep in, but sadly, these aren’t them. If I lie down and if my ear bends , it’ll touch the controls in that ear & screw up the volume or something, so these are my daytime TV buds. I just bought a second set (in red), so they’re ready to replace these as soon as they need charging.
Can’t take a photo as I’m wearing them, but will try to grab a snap when I swap them out for the red ones. I’m actually not sure how long they’ll play, they were in the case charging, I put them in at about 730am, it’s almost noon and they’re still going strong (edit: they were still going at 3pm)
I use them for BT connecting to my phone or tv (and my 47” flatscreen tv is over 13yrs old & didn’t come w BT built in, I connected a BT transmitter, it’s EZ!). I use these as TV buds. Silent home. My neighbors don’t need to hear what I’m watching or listening to…..and yeah, it’s also bc I hate thinking I’m disturbing a neighbor. Lived in my own house until a few yrs ago, now I’m in a big apt complex with ‘who knows’ for neighbors."
"The earbuds have impressive audio quality. Nicely fitting and sleek as well. Lightweight and easy fitting compared to their T9 version.

Only feature I found missing was the ability to connect more than one device at a time. I am having to disconnect one device before attempting to connect to a second device. Easier option would have been just hitting ’Connect’ from second device which should switch the devices automatically. Hope they bring that feature in their future versions."
"These earbuds are fantastic! They come with multiple ear tips to fit both large and small ears, which is a nice touch. The sound quality is excellent, and the battery life is impressive. My old rechargeable wired ones only lasted a couple of hours, but with these, I've used them for about 8 hours over a few days, and the battery is still at 85%. I'm confident they could easily last several more days of regular use without any issues."
"I had a set of more expensive headphones, but I lost them. I don’t like to walk around with expensive headphones anyways as I’m afraid to lose them

I had an earlier version of this product and really enjoyed the product at its price point. This new version is great and they really made it look a lot sleeker and smaller while maintaining the sound quality. It easy to use and setup. The tozo app, gives you better control of your earbuds. You can change you equalizer to your liking. Performance has been great."
"The T20 earbuds are the 4th product by TOZO that I've owned. I’ve learned to never worry about whether or not I'm going to like them while I'm waiting for them to be delivered.

I also have a pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 2, but I use my TOZO buds alot more because the battery life lasts so much longer for the TOZO.

Also, here's a tip that some may find useful. I like to use foam tips on all my earbuds to block outside noise. I like to use the Comply Truegrip Pro premium tips. I first bought them to use with my galaxy buds because that's what they're made for, but I also realized that they fit all of my TOZO buds perfectly, as well!"
"Ive been using these for a couple of months now. I prefer more bass than they provide but I have to say the charge stays forever. They fit in my ear fairly, havent fell out yet, always pairs to my iphone and works without hiccups. Not sure that i would like them as much if I listened to music all day (bass issue) but I listen to a lot of podcasts and theyre perfect for the price."
"I had the T10s for several years and saw they had an upgrade. I like how you can know the charge level on the case as well as individual headphones. (Can see pictures other people posted) There has been a few times where it did not want to auto connect to my phone, but that’s not normally the case. Great headphones and good sound quality. I like how I can charge it on a cordless charger and that it comes with several sizes to match fit for different ear sizes.

My one downside is the controls are a bit wonky. But that’s only because I’m used to T10s and the T20s are different.

TLDR: great headphones for great prices."
"Perhaps it is the style. I am not accustomed to these and had to use ear inserts from an old TOZO to make them usable. Simply did not fit with anything in the kit. I hope they last as long as my old ones, and I hope I get used to them.

Is there a world where these earbuds do not have touch sensing ability? Like when wearing a hoody or a hat that touches the sensor and does volume changes and even pause, FF, RW, all on behalf of the headgear. Is there some unusual method to turn off all touch sensor features? Let the device do the heavy lifting here. Still love TOZO.
PS, with the old-style inserts, these were not fitting into the charger. Removal every charge would be necessary, I modified the plastic charging case by shaping the space between the bud seats to accommodate these older style inserts on these buds. Perhaps someone might please look at this? Still love TOZO, you left me enough material there, leave a bit more and we can both be happy? It now charges well with these improved inserts, and I did not hit any vital organs. LOL"
"I just upgraded from tozo a2 headphones, and it's the first time I stuck with a brand through headphone changes. My other ones still work great too. These have good sound, they're convenient to use (you can use one at a time) and they're cheap too. I also just learned you can connect them to the app and change eq settings. Awesome headphones, would buy again!"
"What can I say? With the earbud market flooded with over priced junk I decided to give these bad boys a try and have been loving them! I recently lost my first pair while at work and bought a new pair right away. Not only did I get it quickly but I got even cheaper then when I first bought them with a coupon Amazon was giving away. The main reasons I love these earbuds is because they last all day, charge quickly, work efficiently along with a strong Bluetooth connection all while being super easy to use. It's a great fit for my ears aiding with decent noise cancellation for a proper sound."
"I've purchased multiple TOZO earbuds sets over the years and have enjoyed how well they work and their value. Recently I did have a warrantable concern with a set of T21s I purchased and contacted TOZO directly for assistance. Their team was quick to respond and had me try some troubleshooting in order to rule out user error or a one-time glitch. In this case the T21s were unfortunately unable to be revived. TOZO offered up a set of T20s at no charge which I did receive and have been very happy with since. It's unavoidable to have periodic product failures or issues but it's how the company responds to these concerns that makes or breaks a customer's experience. In TOZO's case, they responded appropriately, timely and stood behind their product; quickly and completely addressing the situation. I continue to remain a happy customer and will continue to purchase TOZO products moving forward."
"I had airpods a while ago, and one of them got run over. Since then, I've been trying to find some that are comparable, but for a fraction of the price. These are it. They fit well, the quality of sound is great, and anytime I'm talking on the phone, the person on the other side doesn't pick up extra background noise. I can even vacuum without it being too loud for them. Definitely recommend these."
"If you’re looking for a low cost and quality earphone, this is it. I had the TOZO T6 originally and lost them but loved them. Fortunately the price point made them really easy to replace. wanted to try these because they were a little cheaper on sale and had the digital battery display. Within about 5 minutes the case went from 98 to 91% battery, so not expecting loads of listening time. But again, for the price point, I feel like these are the best you can get.

Edit to add from 10pm to 10am, while they were just sitting on my counter, the case went from 91% to 56%. Not sure if this is normal but this seems like an odd jump for unused earphones"
"I've another set of Tozo ear buds and I wore them out! They provide clear, balanced sound while the noise cancellation does it's job well! I used these primarily in my office to either listen music or block out the chatter! No need to get a more expensive brand. These fit the bill!"
"I got these on sale for about $25, and at that price they're a steal. They sound very good, fit better than most of the older models that I have tried, and the app lets you customize the touch functions and EQ. As a bonus, I love the shade of green these come in."
This is my first set of earbuds so I wasn’t sure how they would work or how the sound would be. But I tried them the night I got them and so far I am pleased with the sound quality. Not sure if they are the best but I’m satisfied
"Comfortable, Great sound, Holds the charge for a long time, Battery-life display on charging case is awesome, and what I love best about the earbuds is that they came with SIX different sized earbud rubber caps which is necessary for a perfect fit and to be truly noise canceling! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!"
"So far, I’m liking the product and I like the price even better. I think it’s great to try especially when it being on special. The sound quality is great and people can hear me. My Volume is great as well"
"Great sound for the price. Build quality is what you would expect. I use them as secondary headphones when I need them in a pinch. Touch controls are a bit finicky but likely like most of this product and price. For example, pushing the headphonen back in my ear paused, the music. I still need to figure out how best to use the touch controls, until then I'll stick to controlling with my iPhone and Apple Watch. [Note: sent to me for review]"
"Normally, when you spent 26 dollars on earbuds you think to yourself “well these aren’t going to offer you much” but boy you are wrong once you open the box and use the app. I was also surprised by how many ear tips you get especially if you have large ears the sound is amazing and customizable with the eq settings my phone and tablet were able to connect right away! I’m a happy customer and I’ll keep buying from TOZO more often"
"This was a really good investment. I like that the product is reasonable priced for such good quality. I'm very active, so I tend to be rough with my earbuds and headphones. I have done a lot of heavy sweating and I have taken a shower with these buds since my purchase (approx 3 weeks ago). No damage. I didn't read that the product is water proof, so I wouldn't get in the pool, but they seem to have good water/moisture resistance. Even if I did damage them, they are so reasonably priced that I would replace with another pair 🙂."
"The TOZO T20 earbuds offer excellent value for their price, combining premium features like wireless charging, great sound, and long battery life into a sleek package. They are a fantastic choice for anyone looking for quality wireless earbuds without breaking the bank."
I lost my Samsung earbuds so I decided to get a cheaper replacement. These are surprisingly good. There is no settings for the noise cancelation though like the Samsung earbuds. Disappointing.
"So I just got these out of the box and charged up and am taking them for a test drive and the sound is amazing! The bass is thumping. The highs are crisp and clean. The mid-range sounds are full. These things sound wonderful.

I will have to get back to you on battery life and the ease of use for the tozo app.

But out of the box so far it's a win!"
"I have used many different Bluetooth buds and headsets including some very expensive ones. This is my second set of the T20s, I lost the other set. I've been doing rehab work for a hip replacement by walking in a swimming pool. I went thru several different ones that were presented as waterproof but sadly not so much. When I get into the pool, I usually drop down into the water to get completely wet. While the Bluetooth signal does drop out under water they do come back on when my head gets above the water. I have a several pairs of some fairly expensive buds that are not waterproof and don't sound any better than theses. The only thing, be sure to fit the cushion that goes into your ear to fit properly. That makes lots of difference in the sound quality. They have a great warranty and are a great value."
"I enjoyed my first set of Tozo earbuds, but the sound had faded on the left side and they stopped charging. I felt I got my money’s worth and am trying the T20. Sound is superior on a first try. I’ve had them less than an hour, but all seems good. I love that they have different ear piece sizes—I need xsmall, which I feel is hard to find, but I didn’t spend a lot of time looking; I talked to people instead. The touch works much like the other pair—tried it al and it responds to a delicate touch. Says you can voice activate. I haven’t tried that yet. I expect they’ll work just fine and serve my purposes. Rating is completely based on ease of use upon arrival and immediate sound quality. I can’t rate durability or longevity, obviously."
"I've been using this pair as a secondary device and it has done what I wanted them to do.
Decent noise cancelling and sound quality. It also shows you the percentage of charge, so that is a nice little feature."
"It’s very rare that i make time to leave a product review, single dad and working 50 hours wk etc….
I’ve used all of, if not most , the major brands $$$ and this lil drops of heaven have brought me more enjoyment from the amazing sound quality, the durability and the top notch customer service experience i will only be using Tozo headphones moving forward. The first set i bought were the T6. I live on the beach and like to work out and run near salt water so it’s easy to see why most headphones ive used couldn’t hold up to the wear and tare of water, sand and sweat… Tozo came through as best customer service and support. After a year i had a little sound distortion and one side would occasionally not charge ( probably because of dirty connections after the fact) i figured id just check to see if the headphones had a warranty?
come to find out didn’t have a warranty, just expired, they said they would honor the product and replace the headphones making exception!!!
They are rock solid and now have the T6, the T10, and T20’s and they all get used for different reasons but i will only use Tozo after all that!"
"I was on the hunt for high-value earbuds to gift to friends and came across the Tozo brand. For such an affordable price, these earbuds offer impressive features. They come with a wireless charging case, IPX8 waterproof rating, and a robust 48.5-hour playtime. The dual mic noise-cancelling and 10mm speakers deliver great sound quality, and the LED display is a nice touch. Overall, Tozo provides exceptional value for money, making these earbuds a fantastic gift choice."
"one of the earbuds quit on me after a few days of use. dealing with their customer service was very straightforward. they asked a couple of relevant questions and had a new pair in the mail very quickly. no language barrier. they were actually better to deal with than Amazons customer service.
They have a good range and long battery life. equal range and better battery life than my apple AirPods.
I'd buy them again, no regrets."
"Simple as that.
Sound quality 4/5 - took off a point here because there's a high frequency electronic sound that the left earbud sometimes makes. It's like a ""beep beep boop"" sound that doesn't impact the music being played but can be heard in junction with it. Infrequent and modestly noticeable.

Sound delivery 6/5 - as distinct from sound quality, this mens how much time from when I remove each earbud from the case do I need to spend getting it to produce sound. This includes Bluetooth connectivity, pairing with one another, durability of the case's charging pins, etc. Basically I just want it to make sound. These are the best headphones I have ever owned on the basis of do they work when you want them to. Separately or together....
Battery life- 4/5 About 3-5 hours. Haven't really timed it out, but if you bring the case with you, it's hard to outrun the battery.
Fit- 4/5 They fall out sometimes when I'm doing burpees or shooting jumpers.
Charging case 5/5 - weighty and durable. Led screen shows charge % and confirms charging status.

For the price, 5/5. I didn't buy air pods on purpose, and it's these!!!"
"Love that these are IPX8 waterproof, have been using them daily including in the sauna and have not had any issues whatsoever. Considered other brands of wireless earbuds but the value and water resistance could not be beat!"
"I bought these to replace an aging pair of wireless earbuds. What an improvement! Not only can I hear better, the people I am calling say I sound much better. I am buying a second set to have on hand."
"The delivery, packaging , the quality of plastic is amazing for 19$. These sound good and I am yet to test out the functionality fully, but I am sure this will hold good for at least 2 years."
I am really enjoying these earbuds. They offer solid audio quality and ANC. Call quality is also good and the case with the built-in display is nice to use. Knowing the charge when I open the case is so nice!
"The new TOZO T20 are awesome. TOZO keeps integrating cool new features and technology into each iteration of their earbud products and the new optical battery life is super convenient in eliminating the guess work of how much battery life I have left. The wireless charging also allows me to set them down on their TOZO W1 wireless charging plate and they're charged and ready when I'm ready to use them again. The charging plate also works with my phone, eliminating the need to keep a charging cable readily available."
"This is a really good set of headphones, and the company itself is very communicative and responsive. I've used TOZO's NC9's for almost a year until I lost one of the buds :(

I will miss the active noise cancellation but these headphones are just as clear in terms of quality, and the ENC definitely helps during phone calls. Controls are very simple, just tap the earbud, though that does cause some types of issues when you're just trying to adjust it. Comes with many different sizes of earbuds so they'll fit everybody.

All in all just a great company with great headphones for good prices. 💯"
T20’s are always my go-to headphones. They feel good and audio quality is great! Looks pretty good—they aren’t Apple Headphones but the only thing that makes Apple headphones stand out are a slightly better audio and better features which aren’t very necessary. Connects fast and very easy—I have like 3 pairs already because I can’t get enough of them. Cheap in terms of price but don’t let that fool you—they are amazing headphones!
"Tozo is the best , been a client for ~5yrs. I have 8 ear buds, different version and style and colors . I have 1 pegged to each of my devices. (Tablet, phone, mac, pc, hubbys phone, his tablet,
My Ipad) Even have them at my work. I buy these for gifts. Folks love them.
So easy to pair. I use for zoom video calls and audio is perfect hearing and speaking.

I love the variety of colors. Makes it easy to identify."
"I bought these earbuds back in November of 2023. I use them everyday for about an hour or more depending on what I am doing. Recently I noticed that the left earbud wouldn’t hold a charge longer than 45 min. I tried to troubleshoot it but ended up contacting the company via customer service. I tried doing the Troubleshooting suggestions they gave me, but it still didn’t fix the problem. Now they are sending me a new pair of earbuds at no cost to me. I appreciate them giving me a new pair and I have been very happy with the earbuds up to this point. They are comfortable and you can hear people clearly on Phone call conversations. I have bought Tozo Earbuds before and been satisfied. I will continue to buy from this company."
"Company's customer service is awesome! This model, the T20 works well, however I much prefer the NC2, for its superb sound quality and excellent noise cancellation features."
"These earbuds sound great, fit well with the different sizes of plastic buds and have a good battery life. I've bought 3 pairs and they all work flawlessly. I highly recommend them and the price is incredible!"
"Have had a number of Tozo Earbuds over the years and these are solid. They are comfortable, stable in your ears. Good sound quality with factory set ""flat"" equalization curve (more on this later). Good solid charging case but surprise...surprise! for the first time the orientation of the earbuds to the case is correct so you don't have to sprain your wrist tweeking it to put the earbuds back in the charging case. The Tozo app is fantastic and allows you to use varied frequency equalization curves to get the sound the way you want it or you can customize your own frequency curve. Battery life is good and charging the case can be done either with a USB C cord or wirelessly. Great value."
"I've been using these for about a week now and am thoroughly impressed. The battery life gets me through an entire day of work and the quality is just as good as other expensive brands I've tried in the past. The case is nice and compact, so you can easily carry it in your pocket. It's also nice that you can check the battery capacity from the readout on the case. They seem to be made of quality materials, and for the price, you definitely can't go wrong with these earbuds."
So small and adorable I love this purchase and it Came with charger since I was in a hurry all I have to do it connected it and I’m good to go and it charged very fast.
Great sound. I really like these ear buds. After about a year I started having issues with them holding a charge. I reached out to customer service and they have been super helpful. I would still recommend these
"Was looking for a budget pair of earbuds to use outdoors in all sort of weather. Decent sound quality. Comes with several different sizes of ear tips. Take the time to try all the sizes to find best fit. A good tight fit will improve the bass response. These buds do not have noise cancelling. That was not a concern as I want to be able to hear ambient sounds/traffic when walking in my neighborhood. Battery life is outstanding and I like that you can recharge them in the case without a power hookup. Overall, decent sound and a great value."
"I’ve been using the T6 for years now. I always had an issue with them falling out of my ear, but I still loved them. I gave my daughter the T6s and upgraded myself to the T20s. I really enjoy them. I can wear them all day and they’ll stay put. The audio and touch sensors are pretty much the same. T6 was more sensitive to touch though. I would buy these again if needed."

"Estoy muy satisfecho con la calidad precio de estos Redmi Buds 5.
La calidad de sonido, claridad, volumen y la distancia de conexión (aún con obstáculos) son impresionantes!
Además cuenta con su propia app para configurar diferentes gestos y perfiles que te permiten mejorar aún más el sonido y cancelar el ruido ambiente.
Siento que he pagado el precio justo por un accesorio de muy alta calidad."
"Excelentes, increíble sonido, muy cómodos ya duración de la batería es lo mejor."
"I love these earbuds, the noise cancellation is effective, the sound is great and the call quality is nice. I am glad I finally found the perfect earbuds for me. However, I've already misplaced my right earbud and I am so sad about that :( They work amazing with my Xiaomi phone and connect quickly. You can download the app for more features."
"Play Video
Me gustó mucho éste producto. Se conecta automáticamente a tu dispositivo Xiaomi solamente levantando la tapa del audífono. Excelente servicio ✨"
"Desde que lo compre me a gustado mucho, la carga le duro bastante hasta una semana, claro los utilizo como 7 horas al día"
"Siento que están al Mismo o mejor Nivel de los Amazon echo buds 1.ª Gen, Tiene Excelente cancelación del Sonido el cual yo trabajo en una oficina con muchos Sonidos y la verdad me sorprendieron... trabajo tranquilo y sin Distracciones ,Super livianos a comparacion de los Amazon echo buds..."
"The headphones came in excellent condition, plus delivery was really quick. One downside to this was could not download the app to sync with the headphones, which probably got blocked. Havent tried out the other app, but the reviews do not seem promising."
Good budget choice!
Muy fáciles para emparejar con mi equipo celular.
"Excelentes materiales, comodos, calidad de audio excelente, batería con muy buena duración."
"Equipo defectuoso, no sirve para realizar conversaciones y tampoco sirve el táctil para cambiar o pausar las musicas."
"Es un buen producto, sin embargo, en cuanto a la batería creo que le dieron prioridad a tener mas en el estuche que en los propios audífonos, he tenido otros similares que ni de marca conocida son y a estas alturas cualquier par de audífonos deberían durarte mínimo unas 8 horas, para los que gustamos escuchar mientras trabajamos y estos audífonos duran 3.5 horas, esa es la única pega que les veo, el sonido es bueno y son cómodos, pero de plano lo de la batería no me dejó enteramente satisfecho!"
"Amazing earpiece for music but not good for made calls , I already try two and both had the same problem!"
I keep having issues with how I am able to hear people and how they hear me.
"The sound itself was good, the fit was fine, though it did fall out of my ear once or twice. However, on phone calls, while connected to the Bluetooth of my phone, everybody says that I sound miles away. I tried to unpair and repair the headphones, but it still sounded the same. Returning for the previous model, which worked very well for me previously."
"Totally disappointing.
I have and iphone and later I discover that the Bluetooth although it works is not the best compatibility.
So the sound is terrible.
I also try in an android that suppose to work well but the sound even though was better still was very poor quality.
I return to use my old tozo t6, there were cheaper but they work better."
"Great sound, Great Battery during calls noise cancelation was ok but I did feedback lots of background noise. Love them for the almost 3 months. One one side fitted to stay on my 👂. I drop them 3 times with box and one won't pair at all and the other goes in and out. Should I buy another set 🤔"
Se escuchan muy bien
Se dañaron el segundo día.
"El problema es que por el diseño se caen con facilidad de mi oreja, y eso que las tengo bien pequeñas"
I bought this bluetooth earbuds as a gift but I got disappointed when realized this device can not connect to 2 Bluetooth devices at same time meaning if you watching movies on your laptop you won’t be able to answer an incoming call from your phone. I bought this earbud because the item description says it can be connected to 2 Bluetooth devices at same time but it didn’t. So I don’t recommend because of this reason.
Buenos audífonos se adaptan bien al oído no duele
"Excelente producto, no había experimentado la cancelación de ruido , y es espectacular."
"Según el vendedor, la batería dura aproximadamente 20 horas y este no dura ni 4 horas, se desvincula, no lo recomiendo, no lo compren"
"No son lo que pensaba, muy deficientes."
Good price and quality
"Son cómodos de usar, tienen buena cancelación de ruido y la batería les dura bastante, al igual que la recarga. Los recomiendo."
"Para el precio en el que se encuentran estos buds, he hallado plena paz, en cuanto a comodidad un 9, cancelación de ruido un 8, escucho un promedio de 2 horas diarias, tranquilamente la batería me dura cerca de 3 semanas. Tengo un celular marca Redmi, así que no tendo ningún problema cuando de emperejar se trata. Pueden descargarse la aplicación XIAOMI EARBUDS para personalizar los gestos en los Buds."
Tal cómo está en la publicación
Resistentes
Fue un regalo bien aceptado
"Con cancelación de ruido adaptativo, compite con otro audífonos. Perfecto para ambientes de ruido como gimnasio, el metro y transporte urbano."
Es perfecto!
"Se escucha bien, pero el microfono no le funciona"
"Dommage, la qualité est au rendez-vous mais ceux que j'ai reçu avait un problème, impossible de les synchroniser avec ma tablette xiaomi pad 5 ainsi que mon smartphone."
"Me gustaron mucho, funcionan muy bien, son practicos y de buena calidad,
buen sonido"
Sound good however its microphone feature while wearing is poor.
"I have just tried my earbuds received a few weeks ago and I am really disappointed as one of them does not work. I tried to disconnect/reconnect, charge the product etc, but without success. Furthermore, I am not able to have the touch area work properly. Overall, very disappointing :("
لا يقبل التوصيل على الموبايل من برنامج الشركة الخاص به
Muy contenta con ellos. Llevo usandolos bastantes meses y tanto en el gimnasio como en la oficina me resultan comodos. Buen sonido y comodos.
"Ho aspettato per fare la recensione per valutare bene la resa del prodotto, devo dire che è ottimo, isola dai suoni esterni e non fa interferenza, la musica e i video si sentono benissimo e la batteria dura tantissimi giorni.
Ottimo prodotto"
Sounds like you are in a can when talking with someone. A bit better for music but still not good enough!
"Un diseño elegante que me chulean cada vez que me los ven puestos y con una batería asombrosa como de 4-5 ciclos, aunque nunca me los he puesto a contar porque la batería de los audífonos en sí duran por horas.
Además, cargan bien rápido. Puedo dejarlo 5 minutos y haber cargado casi toda. Ideal para las personas olvidadizas jaja (también tiene función de encontrarlos mediante sonido).
Aunque hay ocasiones que se desconectan, pero probablemente sea mi dispositivo.
Muy fáciles de usar y tiene gomitas para adaptarse al tamaño de tus oídos que incluso lo he usado para ir a correr.
Tiene un sistema de cancelación de sonido bastante bueno.
Sin duda, un increíble artículo para su precio (y mejor si lo agarras en oferta jaja)

Llevo 5 meses con el artículo y siguen funcionando como nuevos."
Angenehm zu tragen. Super Funktionen. Super Sound
great product
"Ottima qualità e molto funzionale, lo uso per tutto in palestra, per parlare a telefono, per ascoltare musica, in viaggio sul treno. Funziona benissimo sia come cuffia che come auricolare. Lo consiglio"
"Top Artikel, Top Qualität, 5 Sterne, immer wieder gern, sehr schneller Versand, Beschreibung passt zum Artikel, Verkäufer Top, kann ich nur weiterempfehlen"
"se ajustan perfectamente y el sonido equivale al producto, sin mas"
"لايوجد عزل ضوضاء
الصوت ليس عالي"
Me gusta porque son pequeños y se adaptan bien al oído
"Son cómodos, la calidad de construcción es muy buena, tienen una textura como de gima muy amigable. El sensor de toque es rápido. La cancelación de ruido yo no la había tenido en otros audífonos y me de dejó asombrado y voy a poner un ejemplo: venía en un autobús de transporte público, me pongo los audífonos ( se meten en el oído y se giran para que queden perfectamente) puse música y se escuchan los sonidos de alrededor, la gente el motor, la música de autobús etc. Al activar la cancelación de ruido...... qué agradable sorpresa, todo se silenció, solo escuchaba mi música. Y cuando digo todo es todo. Eso sí qué me sorprendió. El nivel de volumen en general es igual al de otros audífonos. Pero resalto la calidad de audio qué es muy buena. El precio es muy bueno para lo que ofrecen estos audífonos. Nuevamente me sorprende Xiaomi y estoy muy satisfecho. Adicional a esto, al realizar llamadas los micrófonos aíslan muy muy bien el ruido exterior y te escuchan perfectamente."
💯 fantastic sound is so clear and good iloveit xiomi products...
"Son super bonitos, les dura aproximadamente 3 horas de uso continuo y están cómodos!
Lo único que no me gusto es que no se escuchan tan fuerte (quisras yo estoy costumbrada a oír la música muy alto)"
Muy buen producto por el excelente precio. La cancelación de sonido funciona muy bien en los aviones. El app para teléfono móvil también funciona muy bien. Carga muy bien y dura la carga mucho. Lo único por lo que no le puse 5 estrellas es porque en mi caso los audífonos se salen con facilidad del oído aún usando el dispositivo más grande de los que vienen. Definitivamente no funciona para hacer ejercicio con mucho movimiento como correr.
"Sono qualitativamente buone, unica pecca il volume un po' basso per i miei gusti, ma comunque si sentono bene, forse tarato cosi per un uso continuato per ore"
"There were two huge problems with this earbud set.
1. Nobody could hear me
2. They would not stay in my ear no matter what size of silicone tip I used

I say don't bother trying them. Very disappointing."
El transportista no se pasó por mi casa en ningún momento y tuve que ir a recogerlo
"La batería dura bastante antes de cargar ma caja y se escucha muy bien, tienen cancelación de ruido y transparencia se puede personalizar"
"se oyen de maravilla con buena definición, mereció la pena la compra.el unico punto malo es no poder controlar el volumen de la música con ellos"
"Muy lindo color, funcionan perfectamente, me encantan"
Perfetto.
"Los compré para regalo y la persona que los recibió está encantada. Suenan genial y además son bastante cómodos. El diseño es bonito. Llegó al día siguiente de adquirirlos, justo a tiempo, por lo que estoy muy conforme."
Sound quality was not upto mark. I returned those but not yet received any refund against those.
"Creo que ya no los hacen, pero en verdad han sido mis mejores audífonos, muy buen audio, conexión, duración de la batería y resistencia, además de que el color es poco usual"
"Ottimo microfono e batteria infinita, le uso da circa un mese per lunghe telefonate e non si sono ancora scaricate. Indossando le due cuffie insieme con la funzione apposita si annullano tutti i rumori esterni. Dopo un mese di utilizzo sono assolutamente soddisfatta dell'acquisto"
Sirve muy bien unicamente un tema de conexion a la app
Muy buena calidad de productos
"El audífono es bueno, pero después de cuatro semanas empieza a generar un ruido que afecta el oído, y no te hacen cambio, es terrible"
"Buon prodotto.
In ingresso qualità del suono e riduzione del rumore ottime. Per ascoltare musica sono perfetti.
In uscita l'interlocutore lamenta rumori circostanti, quindi il microfono non riduce il rumore come dovrebbe."
"Tienen buen sonido y se miran muy bonitos, solo creo que los modos de cancelación de ruido les falta pero por lo demás muy satisfecho en relacion calidad-precio"
"Buen sonido, buena duración de batería y cancelación de ruido muy aceptable.
Buena sujeción en la oreja, y al no tener el palito, los hace más cómodos al tumbarte apoyando la cabeza sobre una almohada o cojín"
"Inizialmente usato solo per ascoltare musica e di quello ero soddisfatto. Ora, cercando di usarlo anche per telefonare, ho scoperto che il microfono non merita la sufficienza e non mi si sente.
Purtroppo è passato troppo tempo dall’acquisto per la sostituzione."
"Tienen muy buena calidad de sonido, son cómodos y les dura mucho la batería. Tienen una función para poner pausa y adelantar canciones desde los audífonos."
Non sono soddisfatta di questi auricolari durante l'ascolto della musica spesso si sente un disturbo e nelle telefonate non si sentiva chiaro
"Me gusta la comodidad de los audífonos,el sonido,las funciones como la cancelación de ruido activa aunque es leve,es un gran añadido por el precio,como también el mundo del ambiente."
"Son bonitos, pero tienes que aprender a ponerlos bien en el oído porque si no se caen y no tienes margen de poner una tira como en otros.
Se escucha bien, por el momento.
Más adelante si la cosa cambia, lo pondré por aquí."
"Me gusta el sonido, es un poco incomodo por el modelo, pero ya luego aprendes a colocarlos adecuadamente"
"Por el precio que pagas, tienen una excelente calidad de sonido y bajos. Sumamente recomendarles. Ya qué soy amantes de sonido de alta calidad. He tenido Audio Técnica. Sony Xm3. Los Sennheiser. No me decepcionaron Los Redmi. Lo único que me arrepenti fue del color que elegí."
"Los compré dudosamente porque nunca había usado otros audiófonos inalámbricos aparte de los que tenía (medio chafas de 400 pesos), no sabía como se escucharían estos y no decepcionan ni un poco, la verdad el plástico de los audífonos se siente de buena calidad, se conectan al solo levantar la tapa y son bastante pequeños ( lo necesario para que no te incomoden en el bolsillo) los compre a 949 pesos y la verdad los valieron, llegaron en perfecto estado y con un día antes de anticipación, muy contento con la compra, si nunca has tenido audífonos inalámbricos o solo has usado genéricos del mercado y quisieras invertir en unos, estos son una muy buena opción 😀"
"Funcionan de maravilla, el aislamiento de ruido no es al 100% pero en definitiva notas menos ruido y es mucho mejor comparado a otros audífonos que he tenido."
"Los audífonos tienen larga vida de batería, son bonitos y prácticos, sin embargo, su desempeño no es muy bueno, no hacen la función de cancelar el sonido."
"Pues suenan quiza bajo, pero suenan bien, pero al menos a mi si se me safan, pero eso supongo ya debe ver con el tamaño de mi oreja"
"Ya sabia que no tenían control de volumen de todas formas no me importa los compré igual, calidad de sonido, transparencia , cancelación de ruido, para mí también son muy cómodos como reseñas más importantes de el producto, para el gimnasio, pasear, andar en piragua etecera los usó
Son una pasada"
"El pedido llegó antes de lo esperado, excelente relación calidad - precio.
La cancelación de ruido es buena y general funcionan muy bien, son una muy buena opción."
"Tiene buen sonido, y se sienten de buena calidad, por elcontrario, la cajita no me fue muy funcional, ya que a las 2 semanas de la compra esta no carga, solo carga hasta el 20 o por mucho 29% y pues yo uso los audífonos todos el día, por lo que tener la cajita con los audífonos adentro y conectados, pues no es muy satisfactorio, porque, se me descargan en la calle y no los puedo cargar con su estuche"
"Son cómodos, tarde un poco en encontrar el tamaño de almohadilla que me quedara mejor."
"Tuve que devolver el producto aunque tengo que decir que el servicio de atención al cliente fue muy, muy bueno. De hecho, los volví a comprar"
"Ame sus características, el sonido me encanta, y su forma de silenciar a tu alrededor es la mejor, realmente le doy un 10 de 10"
Un mes de uso y sin quejas
""
"Funciona bien, si tiene buena cancelación de ruido, llevo un día usándolo pero no le encuentro problemas...

Solamente de forma ocasional encontré una distorsión de sonido de forma.muy notoria, quiero pensar que es por la cancelación de sonido o no se.

Lo que no me gusta, adjunto fotos, es que la.image que muestran (primero foto) es un color muy diferente al que realmente es (segunda foto) o es demasiado engañoso o me llegó un diseño equivocado. No pienso regresarlo por ese motivo, pero si advertir a los demás compradores ese detalle, siendo así mejor comprar otro color."
Justo lo que pedí
"Suenan muy bien y la reducción de ruido es más que suficiente para espacios de poco a medianamente ruidosos.
Le falta profundidad a algunas frecuencias bajas pero en general están bien."
Ok
Se le sube todo el volumen y apenas se escucha la cancelación de ruido nadamás sirve por 2 semanas
"Valen lo que cuestan, el material se siente de buena calidad, se vinculan fácilmente y son cómodos.
Para hacer ejercicio no los recomiendo pues se pueden llegar a caer.
Llegaron en tiempo y forma."
"Funcionalidad bastante buena, un color muy agradable, cumple con lo que se dice, llegaron antes de lo esperado."
"Son cómodos , pero
Me salió defectuoso , no se escucha el
Auricular izquierdo , baje instructivo y ni así pude logra q funcionara"
"Son mis primeros audifonos gama media y honestamente estoy encantada, la batería super duradera, el color muy lindos y fáciles de usar"
Excelente para no escuchar a mis compañeras de trabajo que se la pasan platicando.. :). Falta uno en el estuche porque lo tengo puesto ..
Ligeros de uso
Tengo tda y la función de cancelación de ruido es suficientemente buena como para reducir los estímulos externos
"Funcionaron muy bien los primeros 3 meses, muy buena calidad de sonido. A los 3 meses el audífono derecho comenzó a escucharse muy bajo. El colmo llegó cuando a los 6 meses el audífono izquierdo dejó de funcionar completamente."
"Update 9/12/2024: Stellar customer service from Anker! If I could upgrade my review from 5 stars to 10, I would!

So, randomly yesterday I was using my earbuds watching YouTube like I always do, and got a low battery notification. Plugged the case in and put the earbuds away to charge, and decided to get in the shower while they charged up. Came back out to resume watching my show, and for some reason only one earbud connected. Messed around with them for a while trying to get the second one to connect, and even though they both were powered on, I couldn't for the life of me get them to connect at the same time. I checked the paired device list on my phone and ended up noticing that each earbud was showing up as it's own individual device on my Bluetooth list, so my phone would only connect to one at a time. I couldn't get them to reset, unpairing and re-pairing made no difference, restarting my phone made no difference...something was wrong.

I emailed Anker customer service, filled out the form on their website and provided a screenshot of my Amazon order, the order number, and the device serial number on the back of the case. They suggested some things to try (all of which I had already done), and when none of that worked, they apologized for the problems and agreed to replace my earbuds 100% free of charge! The rep said I should have a new pair within 5 business days. I got a shipping confirmation this morning...and guys, I had brand new set of earbuds this afternoon! Less than 24 hours after filing a ticket, they had replacements in my hands. That is absolutely STELLAR customer service for a $20 pair of earbuds! Now read the original review below, and order these with confidence. It's unfortunate that mine had such a random and wonky issue, but trust that Anker will take care of you if necessary. Thanks for reading!

Ok, first of all, I don't buy expensive earbuds. Never have, never will. I like good sounding music but I'm not an audiophile, I have kids and dogs, I travel for work occasionally, things get lost, etc. I've been using Boltune BT-BH020's for the last several years with a lot of success. Good sound quality, nice little magnetic case, USB-C charging, etc. My wife and I both have 2 pairs each, and they were about $35 a pair the last time we bought some. One pair finally crapped out on me so I went to order another set, and unfortunately they no longer exist. Not surprising considering the lifespan of cheaper Chinese brands on Amazon, but I was still a little disappointed.

I liked the form factor of the Boltune case so I started looking for similar options, and landed on the Anker Soundcore P20i. I have always had good luck with Anker chargers and accessories in the past, so I was expecting a good, simple set of earbuds for $20, but nothing fancy. I tell you what though, I'm pretty blown away with what you get with these - easily the best ""budget"" level earbuds I've ever used.

Packaging is typical Anker - excellent. Well put together, well protected. The earbud case itself is just slightly smaller than my old Boltune cases, but it comes with an attached lanyard, and has a notched area in the front for ease of opening - something that Boltune never got quite right (opening those cases was always a PITA, especially in the dark). Operation is simple - open the case and the earbuds power on (they will automatically go into device pairing mode if they haven't been paired yet). Return the earbuds to the case and close it to power them down and recharge. A couple additional sets of different sized earbud inserts are included so you can find the size that works best for your ears, as well as a 6"" USB-C charging cable and a well written instruction manual. Of note, Anker placed plastic covers over the charging prongs to keep them from being damaged in shipping or powering on accidentally and draining the batteries - a nice touch. The case battery was almost fully charged upon arrival and only took about 10 minutes to top off, and the earbuds showed 100% via the app right out of the box (more on the app in a second).

Once paired, the sound quality is fantastic, especially at this price point. They easily outperform my other earbuds, especially in the low end. Mids and highs are crisp without being screechy or piercing. I can't really comment on bluetooth range as my phone is usually in my pocket while I'm mowing the lawn or working in the garage, so I've never really needed to test that aspect. Battery life is advertised as 10 hours on the earbuds alone without charging them at all, and 30 hours if you return them to the case to recharge between uses. I haven't had to recharge the case yet so I can't confirm that, but I have no reason to doubt that they'll work as advertised. They also say that ten minutes of charging will get you 2 hours of listening time, so these thing would be great for the airport even if you forgot to charge them beforehand and only have a few minutes between flights.

What really sets these things apart though? The app! It is well designed, obviously created by native English-speaking developers, and is simple and intuitive to use. The first time I synced the earbuds to the app, I got an alert for a firmware update! I've NEVER had a cheap pair of earbuds that had that kind of support from the manufacturer - really awesome to see. Going beyond that, you can see the battery level for each earbud, configure the sound profile you prefer, turn on a bass boost if that's your thing, you can configure the left and right touchpads on the earbuds to do the function of your choice (answer, hang up, go forward one track, go back one track, etc) - and there's even a device locator that will play a loud high-pitched beep through the earbud of your choice if you accidentally drop one and can't find it. That feature alone is worth it's weight in gold - I can't tell you how many times I've dropped an earbud off of my nightstand and had to root around looking for the stupid thing, lol.

All in all, I'm really impressed with these for the money. Hands down the best earbuds I've ever owned, and they are the cheapest so far! Well done, Anker!

Also - I'm not a bot, not a shill, and nobody paid me to say this. Just a happy, human customer who's impressed with the product!"
"Big earbud fan here. Time to replace aged ones and the two I tried previously had eye appeal and fit but both had underwhelming sound, which is the only important thing to me next to fit of course.
This pair simply amazed me. Look good, charged up and paired immediately, fit straight out of the box felt customized and the sound was good out of the gate but absolutely divine after music app equalizer personalization. Just wow! So happy.
Looked up the app but did not download; refuse to use anything *optional* that takes over tech that *I paid for.* Will update if necessary of course but honestly, these are amazing and a great value as well."
"I recently bought these budget Bluetooth earbuds, and I’ve been pleasantly surprised by their performance! For the price, the sound quality is quite good—clear audio with decent bass, perfect for music, podcasts, and calls. They’re comfortable to wear for extended periods, and they stay securely in place, even when I’m on the go.

Pairing was quick and hassle-free, and the battery life is impressive for such a budget option, easily lasting through my workday with light use.

While they’re not high-end, they deliver excellent value for the cost. If you’re looking for an affordable pair of earbuds that get the job done, these are definitely worth considering!"
"So after going back and forth on whether I wanted to spring for high end $200+ earbuds or just get a budget pair and hope they were good enough, I decided to order two different pairs in the $20-30 range: These Anker Soundcore P20i's and a random cheap pair that seems to be marketed under a bunch of different random brand names (the ones I got were Sajawass), but which had a perfect 5 star rating.

Upon receiving both, I immediately needed to compare and decide which pair I would be keeping. I tried the Soundcore P20i's first. As others mentioned, the sound profile is quite bass heavy, but not muddy as I expected. To my pleasant surprise, the overall clarity and quality was quite good! Would have thought these were something near the $60-80 price point. What's even better is once I used their in app EQ to tone down the bass (using bass reducer or treble booster setting), they were actually quite nice. Now, from a musician and audiophile standpoint, I can tell you that these are nowhere near hitting that mark, but still great for affordable everyday use! When I tested the other brand of earbuds I bought, I immediately knew these P20i's were the clear winner! The other ones sounded like the cheap wired buds you might buy in-flight if you forgot your own. They left the soundstage very empty and flat with no spatial separation and absolutely no bass!

Pairing was simple and I've been able to maintain connection while walking into other rooms without taking my phone with me. I also like that you can customize the touch controls to do what you want. Call quality was also great. The person I called said they could hear me clearly. Granted, I was in a quiet setting, so that may or may not be the case in a noisy environment.

All in all, at the $20-30 price point, these P20i's are an absolute steal! If you're not in need of ultra high-end sound or active noise canceling, but still want pretty good sound at a crazy affordable price, these are the buds to get!"
"I made the (incredibly stupid) decision to work remotely for three days while simultaneously chaperoning a school sports championship trip. I have a Jabra headset that I normally use, but I needed something smaller due to limited packing space.

I saw the reviews, features, and price on these and decided to give them a try, and I am so glad I did. I go into detail below, but bottom line: these are great travel headphones and worth every penny, and I liked them so much I actually bought a second pair.

Microphone: people on the other end said my voice sounded a little funny. However, I was making these calls from the hallway just above the arena(the quietest place I could find in the stadium), and everyone could hear and understand what I was saying despite the nonstop cheering, announcing, other people’s conversations, and general overall noise level.

Speaker: just as amazingly, I could hear the people on the other end. The sound came through just about as clearly as my normal headset and I had no trouble listening to my regular meetings, even when my kids’ team was on the field and I would have preferred to be listening to that. Even more impressively, I usually only wore one at a time so I could keep an ear on the kids I was supposed to be watching, and I was still able to hear just fine most of the time.

Comfort: I usually hate earbuds. I don’t know if I have weirdly shaped ears or what, but generally after about 30 minutes my ears start to hurt and I have to take them out. I kept one of these in my ear all day from roughly 8 am to 4 pm, and they didn’t bother me at all. I honestly forgot I was wearing them sometimes. These also came with 3 sizes of ear cups, which I appreciate.

Other features: The case has magnets to hold the earbuds snugly, and closes with a satisfying click. The little loop was convenient for hooking to a belt loop or my bag. The battery lasts a long time, I was talking all day and barely dented the battery life.

Bottom line, take it from me: these earbuds are great, and don’t try to work while you’re chaperoning a school trip."
"I'll echo what other reviews have said - the Soundcore P20i earbuds are an excellent value!

I have more sets of headphones/earbuds than I care to admit, but I somehow manage to talk myself into buying another pair every so often. With these, the excuse I made for myself was that I didn't have a decent pair of Bluetooth earbuds. I had a set of cheap BT earbuds that I picked up from a local convenience store a couple years ago, but I never really liked them that much and so rarely used them, which meant the battery was always dead whenever I did need them. By the time the battery was done charging, I didn't need to use them anymore, so they would sit on the shelf for a month until I needed them again, at which point the battery was dead again, and so on...

I thought maybe if I had a decent pair that I liked better, I would actually use them more often and wouldn't run into that same cycle of frustration. I was thinking about getting a pair of premium buds that everyone seems to have these days, but was hesitant to drop ~$200 on something that could still wind up sitting in a drawer 95% of the time. I stumbled onto these and thought the $20 price tag seemed perfect, especially seeing as Soundcore is a division of/owned by Anker. I love Anker's products, so I figured these would be good quality, so I could see how they work out and decide if I wanted to spring for a more expensive upgrade later on (or if my aversion is just to wireless buds in general and save myself $180).

Well, I've had these for a couple months now and they ended up being even better than I expected. I'm sure better quality could be had, but it's hard to beat the value you get with these. They sound great, connect easily, and stay in my ears (for the most part). I don't use them every day, but that's mainly because I have a wife and young kids that are frequently trying to get my attention, and these block too much external sound to hear them well (hitting pause and asking ""What did you say?"" every 10 seconds is more frustration for everybody than it's worth, haha). Just using one earbud works as a workaround, but still, I'd prefer to have music in both ears if I can.

Side story - I know it's stupid, but I have a weird habit of squirrelling away expensive stuff. Instead, I am naturally inclined to use a cheaper, not-so-nice variant in my regular routine, I guess in a backwards way of trying to keep my nice things nice. These earbuds are such good quality that I find myself wanting to ""save"" them and keep them hidden away. Moral of the story, the quality definitely seems like a notch above my expectations for this price point, which is a great thing!

If you're looking for a decent pair of wireless earbuds that won't break the bank, these are an excellent option. I am very pleased with my purchase - it was well worth it!"
"I purchased these earbuds in early July and gave them a full charge right away. Over the years, I've tried several high-end earbuds, but my last set, from another high-end brand, kept falling out of my ears, and given the price, I was constantly worried about losing them. So, I decided to give these a try, and I couldn’t be more thrilled with my decision.

I’ve now had them for two months, and during that time, I’ve used them 2 to 3 times a week at the gym for two-hour sessions, in addition to regular walks. Remarkably, since my initial charge, I haven’t had to recharge them at all. That kind of battery life is truly impressive. The sound quality is great for my needs, and the fit is secure, giving me peace of mind during workouts. I absolutely love using these earbuds and highly recommend them.

How could anyone go wrong at this price point with such a solid product? These can’t be beat for durability and price."
"I wanted to get a pair of earbuds that were wireless because I was tired of the constraints and nuisances of wired, and headphones are uncomfortable and mess with my OCD too much.

These seemed to posess all the features and qualities I was looking for, and it did deliver. I don't think that these are garbage, but I definitely don't think 40$ is a price befitting for cheap Dollar Store earbuds; I will explain what I mean.

Firstly, the base sound profile - it's terrible. I am no audiophile, but I do have some standards. They are not drowned in mud like my previous Monster Achieve Airlinks, but still very flat and lacking body.

The soundstage/spatial sound is decent; it fills the stereo appropriately, but don't expect to feel it project.

The buds come with a companion app which allow you to use different EQ presets (my personal favorites are Piano or Accoustic, which help bring the sound up a bit). These presets also program into the buds, meaning if you connect them to your PC or another device, they will still retain the preset. My only gripe is that when you use solo bud mode (which I do a lot while at work for environmental awareness), it will not activate; you need to have both buds connected for it to activate, which to me makes no sense.

The fit is something I cannot get really comment positively on. I have had these for a month and while the right bud is secure, I can never get the left one to secure, no matter how much I fasten it nor what eartip sizes I use. Though this may be a fault of my canal shape. The comfort otherwise is very good.

Battery life is great. They come with a 10 hour charge and a case that holds up to 30 I believe. I use these for work and then take them home and use them for my PC, which the buds are fully charged for by then.

The touch controls are responsive, albeit difficult to get right as I can't always tap correctly due to not knowing where my finger is in relation to the bud (though this just may be a me thing). You can also change the taps/holds for one or both buds, amd program them to do different things - I like having single tap for play/pause, double-tap to skip forward, and long press for Assistant.

The verdict in general - I think they are a decent humble pair of earbuds not trying to present themself as anything extraordinary, however I would not recommend them for audiophiles, unless you love bass and know how to EQ to your preference."
"I've had many earbuds Wired and Wireless I actually like to have both as I am not solely relying on wireless for longer use rather running out of battery. But anywho I recently had a pair of JBL Vibe earbuds and those were hands down good . But... I sold them because I needed extra income but I end up getting these as I wanted something wireless.
In my opinion I love the sound, the bass is not bad whatsoever it hits just right and I don't really need an equalizer to add. The clarity in sounds and background vocals is top notch.
I loved the optional app install but I recommend it because the controls were very annoying as I installed the app and I was able to change the tap controls to my liking. Not a lot of options but I just wanted to change the amount of taps for play/pause and reverse and previous song skips while I'm riding my electric scooter
The charging case is a clam type case but the earbuds click just right when putting them in and it also pauses Music and turns off when put in case.
Pros: Sound is amazing
Optional app

Cons: Plastic build on case and earbuds
No pairing button if Device is searching for Earbuds

I love these just wish it was a better material rather a semi tough plastic and a pairing button for devices that might not find the quick enough just to keep the pairing mode a little longer. . But I definitely recommend them if you need some earbuds to put around with no wires.
Will update review if anything changes."
"I am an earbud snob and an audiophile, and I am VERY impressed with these earbuds.
On one hand, you get what you pay for, as there is no ambient sound or noise blocking function. So you get the almost-forgotten sensation of something blocking your hearing when you put these earbuds in -- you know, the way they all felt before we got spoiled with the ANC/Ambient Sound functions on the more modern and expensive earbuds. But. You get excellent sound and a very good mic. For $20!! (I got it on discount).

Here are all the CONS I've noticed so far:
- Ergonomic, very comfortable and snug in the ear. I often have a problem with that (narrow ear channel, sensitive ears). No issue here. Very comfy. Not falling out.
- The mic catches my voice well, people are hearing me quite well on phone calls.
- The quality of the equalizer is impressive.
- The Bluetooth connection was fast and seamless.
- I love the bass on these!
- Listening to music is really pleasant, there is no excessive treble, the bass is deep and juicy, and there is a selection of pre-set equalizers for different music genres. (In the app.)

IMPORTANT: You get a whole bunch of additional perks if you install the Soundcore app. They have a huge selection of ambient sounds and white noise, as well as customization of touch controls and a few other helpful features including access to customer service through the app.

UPDATE:
Two cons discovered so far:
- Audio connection seems to have a lag at the start of a phone call. People have told me they can barely hear me, and then in a few seconds said it was fine now.
- They seem to pick up external noises better than my own voice in noisy surroundings, like transport or in the street. That's unfortunate, because I primarily need earbuds on the go, not while I'm at my desk in a quiet office."
"2nd Edit -> It is refreshing when a manufacturer stands behind their product. Although I the performance in an environment with Bluetooth interference was disappointing, Anker reached out to be and addressed the situation. Excellent customer support!

Edited -> When I reviewed this initially, I had one issue that I considered to be so niche as to not affect my rating. When connected to a Garmin Forerunner watch AND using an ANT + heart rate strap and an ANT + foot pod, there were such frequent dropouts as to be unusable. Given that a watch isn't the most powerful Bluetooth transmitter/receiver and ANT + operates at 2.4GHZ while making no attempt to respect the Bluetooth protocol, I wasn't overly surprised. Other earbuds have had an occasional dropout (one or two an hour) in this situation of interference. I then used these earbuds with my phone with no issues until ..... I went to the gym. In the gym, with many many other people wearing Bluetooth headphones, there were a significant number of dropouts. Out of curiosity, I then wore them connected to my phone but while running with the Garmin watch and ANT + accessories and it was unusable. I am therefore convinced that these earbuds do not do well in an environment with 2.4GHZ interference. Considering many would like to use these in an environment like a gym, I am forced to reduce the rating by two stars.

**********************************************************************************************************************
We are in the price range of cheap wired earbuds almost here…. Yet, you get true wireless earbuds with a nice recharging case. Sound quality is decent; actually better than a major branded pair I have that were about double the price. They pair easily. The touch controls work well. My one gripe; on the touch controls you don’t have volume control."
"If you're like me, you'd probably worry about it not fitting or all the things they claim not be true, or if you're worried about soundleaking (where people can hear it from the outside) it doesn't leak the sound,
And it is waterproof I accidentally left it in my pocket and put it in the wash not even in the case just alone earbud in the wash and it works perfectly still, lucky maybe but still great fitting comfortable affording, now if you are like well I don't wanna buy this it's to much, buying new earbuds that are bad over and over is more expensive than this believe me I've done it I got tired of the 10 dollar range and bumped it up perfectly fitting (they have the ear sizers) perfect for kids and adults if you have the app you can adjust your sound quality very nice great feature and you can customize what happens when you tap the sides like either pause music or skip and it's very nice looking"
"Anker products are the best for your electronics. I have been purchasing Anker products since 2015. I purchased my first Soundcore earbuds since 2019. I’ve tried other brands of earbuds but always go back to Anker. Set up is easy, connecting to the Bluetooth is seem less and hassle-free! The Anker earbuds are noise canceling headphones. There is no noise leakage no matter how high the volume (trust me I’ve tried to find a missing earbud by turning the volume all the way up in a completely quiet room & still couldn’t find the earbud)!! 🤣 I use the Souncore P20i to connect to the work desktop so I can listen to my favorite DVD documentaries or Netflix documentaries or stand-up shows while I work. Charging is quick and a full charge will last up to 8 hours. I have recommended Anker products to all my coworkers and friends. Prices are midrange to expensive, I stay at the midrange end as I sometimes tend to loose my earbuds 😂 . So far I have both the Liberty Neo & Life A1 in my work bag just in case I accidentally leave one at home or at work. I always like to have a back up! I also have the Anker Soundcore A20i True Wireless Earbuds in my weekend bag when I go to do laundry. My first & favorite will always be the Liberty Neos which I have in my nightstand to listen to ASMR YouTube videos to sleep and to block out Fourth of July fireworks! 😩
Phone calls are crisp and clear on my end however my BFF complains that she can hear me AND all the background noise! I have no complaints about any of the Anker earbuds, I love them!! 😍"
Very good Bluetooth Earbuds overall. Works and sounds great with Audible and Spotify on my Google Pixel 6a while working out or going for a walk and works fine with Hulu Plus as well for watching my favorite TV shows at the local coffee shop. I have used the mic for video calls on Facebook Messenger and the person on the other side said they could hear me clearly. My only complaint is the fact the it comes with a dinky 5 inch long USB C to USB A charging cable that was way too short to be of much use and did feel a little flimsy and cheap but the fact that it uses the USB C standard for charging means you can use any other USB C charger you have laying around such as my Samsung brand Adaptive Fast Charger with a 5 ft cord that came with my old Samsung Galaxy A20 Smartphone that my Pixel 6a replaced. Other than that not a bad product for the price but I recommend getting a longer USB C cable and wall charger for additional convenience if you don't have one. If you do use the USB C to USB A cable included a USB port or charger capable of at least 5 volts 2 amps will work best.
"iPhone user here. I’ve been using these for about 2 weeks now. Normally I use AirPods Pro’s but I lost the original case and bought a replacement, not from Apple, that has messed up after 2 months twice. I love Anker products so I figured I’d give these a try since they cost less than a replacement AirPods charger.

First impressions were that it’s kind of a bulky case and it’s hard opening with one hand. Just a slight inconvenience. The fitting is pretty good. I’ve worn these for hours without much discomfort. My ears get sweaty so they slip out a bit but I just push them in a bit and I’m good to go. ( heres a tip: download soundcore app and set both ear controls for one tap to “nothing”. Helps avoid accidentally activating a function if you’re just adjusting your earbuds)

There battery seems to last for ever! Even the case charges them up super fast! They sound great! Bluetooth connects smoothly and instantly with my iPhone 13 Pro. I have no complaints about quality. I haven’t accidentally dropped them yet but they seem to hold pretty good inside the case if you opened the case and try to shake them out.

Overall they do what they are meant to do. Sound good, connect easy, last a long time, charge fast. If you don’t need anything fancy like noise canceling and noise pass through then this is a very good option to check out. I’m looking forward to using them long term and seeing how they perform!"
"I’ll be the first to admit I’m not an earbud person. Mostly because they ALL hurt my ear canals. I don’t care how small, how padded or of what material, they hurt. The only solution is a pair I have that sit just outside the ear. Of course you give up sound quality but that’s ok. I’d rather not be totally tuned out of my environment and be able to carry on a conversation without removing them than fumble around taking them out if approached. I’m also not concerned at all with sound quality. If I can hear the sound clearly and loud enough I’m happy. I, at this point in time, only use them when watching a movie on my phone while laying on my couch at home. So I don’t have a huge need for them. With all this being said, I am interested in expanding their use as I’ve always wondered why everyone is walking around with 1 earbud in constantly. What are they listening to that’s so important that they can’t be without it on all the time? Then I thought maybe they are also for phone calls though I’ve never taken a call using earbuds. I seldom answer the phone either. Big surprise right? So I saw these and at their price point I thought I would give them a try. While I like mine that sit outside the ear they are very light and could fall off and I’d never know unless they were in use. They also sit at the exact location on my ear that my glasses are already utilizing so they again, aren’t as secure as they could be. These should be more stable if nothing else. They paired easily and charged with no problem. However, they still literally make my ears sore even after they are removed. I must just have extremely small canals. But they are stable and I would know if one came out which was my concern. As far as all the tuning I just get them to a place the bass isn’t thumping or overwhelming and I’m good. But there are lots of adjustments that can be controlled via the app. I’m not crazy about controls on the buds as I never get the reaction I intended so if I do need to make an adjustment it’s easier for me to just grab my phone and do it. The other thing I don’t understand is why advertisers say the charging case extends playtime. No it doesn’t. If it did, to me that would mean they could remain in my ears for a longer amount of time before they run out of charge. Taking them out to put them in the case to charge is no different than using a charger other than you don’t have to be plugged in. So nothing extends battery life because once they are charged, they are charged. They can’t charge any further. It bothers the hell out of me that this is said and people must believe it, but it’s simply not true. If there’s some magic I’m missing regarding charging cases someone please correct me. These certainly last long enough for me to watch a movie and I put them back in the magic case after use and then typically plug it all in anyway so I seldom hear the Low Battery warning. I keep them charged because I don’t want to want to use them and they die in the middle of my movie, you know, because that extended battery life didn’t work out for me, and I don’t want want to wait even the 10 minutes for the 2 hours of battery life they are advertised to gain in that time span of charging. When I want them, I want them now. But I would prefer a simple tone alert instead of words.m if the battery does go low. I haven’t started using them more than my other ones yet because honestly, I’m a little self conscious, but when I do, I will use these because of the stability factor. I know earbuds can be super expensive and these are not, but I believe they are of better quality than their price would suggest. I can’t think of anything I would want them to do that isn’t already being done. Or honestly, what others might want out of them lol. Definitely recommend them."
"Received these today and tried them out on a long hike. Incredible sound quality! Now it's only been one day, but the build quality is exceptional as well, and I'm anticipating being able to enjoy these for a long time to come. I can't believe I spent less than $20 for these. I'm just some retired dude who rarely feels like he got his money's worth these days. Maybe $20 - $30 for something like this is no big deal for some people. But I've spent plenty more on similar products in the past and didn't get any better sound quality or build quality. Who knows they may just burn out in a year. But my guess is they'll be with me for a while more than that. Don't waste your hard earned money of anything more expensive unless you just need to show people you can spend the money on the big name stuff, and pretend the quality is sooooo much better. I ain't got the ego or the money to waste on that stuff."
"I would give these 10 stars if I could. They are the best sounding Bluetooth earbuds I have ever owned. The quality of the sound rivals my wired gaming headphones which were expensive five years ago.

I’ve been wearing them since they arrived, and they’re very comfortable. I don’t mind the tapping for various functions, talking to my husband with them was easier on these than usual. My car is old so I have one that goes through my stereo. I always have problems with it. This will be much easier.

I haven’t tried them on my treadmill yet. They don’t stop like others when I take one out, though, so the issues I was having with other brands while running likely won’t happen. I will post an update after an intense workout.

So far I am in love with these. My favorite song sounded so good it gave me goosebumps."
"These earplugs sound fantastic. Fantastic when I put them on my ears I’m telling you that bass Blow me away for the price that I paid for these you will love the sound that comes out of these earphones. Now, if it’s unplugged from the wall it will not charge the plugs. You know how most cases charges them so you don’t have to plug them in all the time . You will have to plug these in to the wall. You know the cord is so short, but I have another cord so I use that, I love these earphones. When you get through hooking up the app. There’s a place where you can put it in different sound that you want. I got mine in bass +. I like what that man said on his video for the price these will blow you away. I love them but get them now because they’re like $19 so you’re gonna pay something like 21 and some change. Enjoy there I am!!👋🎼🎼"
"I was looking for a set of wireless earbuds to use mostly with my Windows PC, and after trying some others that had some frustrating issues these seemed worth a try even though they're surprisingly cheap. I was guessing that many of the ratings for these may not be legit, but after trying the earbuds I can confirm they're as good as the ratings indicate.

The case itself feels cheap, which is what you would expect for earbuds at this price range, but the lid closes solidly and feels nice, and it has USB-C and a charging light on the front (where it should be). The earbuds themselves are decent feeling matte plastic with round silicone tips, and I'm happy to report that they're comfortable even after an hour of wearing them. This is definitely not true for other earbuds I've used so I was surprised at how good they feel for the price.

Audio quality wise, they're decent. Nothing special but pretty good considering the price range. If you really care about music quality you should look at a more expensive pair, but for everything else they've been great. The Soundcore app for iOS is also very good and lets you customize the touch functions on each earbud, which is super helpful if you want to disable single touches and avoid accidentally triggering actions. The only thing I wish it would let you do is enable/disable Game Mode using a touch function, but I can live without this.

Overall, Anker did a nice job with these. I don't think you can find a better pair of truly wireless earbuds for the price."
"Sound quality is okay, there's some distortion in the sound quality. I have another pair of soundcores which dont have this problem. These things have a lot of bass, a little too much in my opinion. The clarity of the music is obviously distorted even more as you turn up the volume, and the bass becomes uncomfortable over 60%. I usually bump the volume to 60%-65% when working out to get my last set in when I'm tired. I cant do that with these as the bass is too loud. I had to download the app to reduce the bass which was easy though. After reducing the bass the sound distortion is much better. But the sound quality doesn't feel too crisp. I would say this step is a necessity or the sound quality is pretty bad.

Fit is amazing though - Small, light, and doesn't slip out easily for my ears. These are probably the best feeling ear buds I've worn so far. (8th pair of ear buds I've owned, all different kinds). The package only came with 2 sizes of silcone ear pieces so not for people with extra large ears canals.

Controls - if you download the app it allows you to set the tap controls which is very convenient. Each ear has 3 touch options, tap, double tap, and hold.

I don't plan to make calls with these so I can't speak for that usage.

The case is nice and compact and came with a ""wrist"" strap. Its more like a finger strap, just enough to help hold on to it. Would have been nice if it was larger and adjustable to fit on the wrist."
"I have been searching for earbuds that fit my small ears for a few years and I finally found them! However, it is important to note that the smaller size is achieved by reducing the features and specifications so there is a trade off between quality and size but that is understandable. I am not so concerned about quality because I have good hearing and I only need these to listen to podcasts while I am doing chores, so they are not meant to be used for important phone calls where it's important to catch every word. I also realize that there is a trade off because I don't want to pay a high price for something that I could easily misplace, so I think there is a good balance between quality and size."
"I ordered these ear buds a couple of months ago to replace my ""Soundcore by Anker Life A1 True Wireless Earbuds"" because the cover over the pause button on the one of those that I used most had borken off. I have to say that the sound on the A1 model was better, probably in part because they more fully fill the ear and block out more of the ambient sound.
But these are handy to pop in and take out thanks to the antenna stub that sticks out of the ear, which functions as a handle and you don't have to mess with that removable elastic piece on the top of the A1 that can come loose in the process of removing the earbud from your ear.
What I find most inconvenient about this set is the lack of a pause/stop button. The manual says that you can pause the audio with a double tap at the top end of the antenna stub. I have only been able to get that to work for me on a few occasions. Most of the time, it doesn't function.
Perhaps there is some very specific way of tapping it that I haven't discovered, or maybe I should be doing the second tap faster or slower. I have tried it a variety of ways, but it's very hit and miss, mostly miss. At this point, I'm tired of trying and I've pretty much given up on getting it to work, so I just pull out my phone and hit pause on the podcast or music playing screen."
"I love these little things! The openings to my ear canals are small, and I have tried so-o-o many different headsets in an attempt to find one that is both comfortable, and will stay in my ear, and voila! The sound is superb, and haven't had anyone complain ""You're breaking up."" Adore the little charging case, and the fact that there are color choices. My only issue I have with these, is that the directions inn the ""starter guide were minimal and virtually no help to me at all. I scanned for the instruction manual, and it was really no better. Luckily, I was able to figure out how to use them, but beyond turning them on and off, I have no idea if they have any other features, i.e. volume control, a way to mute, but I can live with that. I highly recommend this product!!"
"The “bud” part of the earbuds do not hurt at all. But the part thats on your ear, hurts after using it for a while. I’m not sure if that is because of the design or because of my small ears.

I think these earbuds are worth what I purchased them for $19.

I never worry about the battery. The charge usually last me long.

I haven’t had issues with the bluetooth connectivity. Although I wish they were like the Apple AirPods where they connect as soon as you open the case.

I didn’t know at first but the case looks similar to the Beats wireless earbuds. Some people could mistake it for a Beats “knockoff,” but that is not a worry of mine.

The audio quality is definitely not low. I cannot say that it is very high audio quality. As long as I can hear my music and it doesn’t sound really bad, I’m happy."
I have always loved this company. They put out really great products. But this time they really out did themselves. I lost the right ear piece for a month. And I just found it... In the dryer. It went through 2 load in the washing machine. And one through the dryer. I already assumed it was broken. There was not way. If the water didn't brake it for sure the heat from the dryer would have killed it. NOPE!!! No issues at all! Charges fine. Connects immediately. It works... Yeah yhe mic sucks. It pics up everything. But im not buying a $20 dollar headset and expect $100 quality but I will say if im in a quite area I can whisper and it pics it up. Great for my therapy appointments as I have to take them at work where people can hear what i am saying. The sound is great. Deep bass. Clear voices. Just make sure you put them in properly. I really suggest you get these and invest in memory foam ear things. They fit better and stay on better. It also helps to seal in your ear correctly.
"I misplaced my second set of AirPods and didn’t want to spend another $200 on something I’m likely to lose again. I found these on sale for $20 and figured why the heck not. They’re by no means a replacement for Apple’s buds, but they’re at least half as good for a tenth of the price.

Audio quality isn’t the best, but it’s passable. I’m not a fan of the bass boost as it makes everything else sound muffled and unclear. I tried turning it down with the EQ in the app, but it doesn’t seem to have any effect. Minus points for that.

The build quality is ok. The magnets that hold the buds in place have a satisfying snap to them. Plastic feels brittle. I’m a little concerned with the flimsy lid/hinge on the case which seems like it will be the first thing to break. However, I’d be happy even if they only last a year since they are so cheap and easy to replace.

I’m not sure I would pay full price for these, but they’re an amazing deal at half off. Definitely snag a pair if you can and you’re prone to losing these things like I am."
"I got these just to play the game Undawn on my Android phone. I always buy Anker / Soundcore products. They make very good quality headphones, earbuds, portable speakers, and chargers. These P20i earbuds are another great product with a good price. I recommend these to anyone looking for a good pair earbuds that come at a good price that won't break your bank. These are also perfect for Android/ Mobile gaming. The microphone pics up sound very well and they also work great for phone calls as well. The only thing I dislike about these is the bass is good but wish it was a little bit deeper. Most of the other Anker Soundcore products I own have deep hard hitting bass in those little packages these I'm sorry to say are a bit on the lower hitting side when it comes to bass. But still sound great and are very good as they are..."
"As a mom of 3 toddlers, two of which have ADHD and sensory needs… headphones are a must-have. I’m also ADHD with sensory needs and I’m super sensitive to loud sounds like banging and slamming, which my kids do a lot of. I didn’t read the entire listing name or all the features of these earbuds because I just needed SOMETHING but honestly, these are the best purchase I’ve made. As soon as I put them in and turn on music or a podcast, the loud playing, banging, and slamming of toys is suddenly entirely drowned out. They’re very noise-canceling. Because of these headphones, I’m able to remain calm and address my children’s needs with patience. These help me with my overstimulation and overwhelm. Best purchase I’ve made this far. The sound is also very crisp and pumps me up for my evening workouts!"
"I wasn't a fan of the design, as it mimics the Apple earbuds. I'm an Android guy so I naturally am biased against Apple devices..... nonetheless my bad turned into my benefit. I bought a set for my girlfriend who is an Apple user, and evidently bought two instead. So I said what the heck I'll give them a try....Impressed!....Good sound.... the noise canceling is a little bit challenged, but for the price you can't beat them. You can also program the number of Taps on each side to perform different functions on your device through their app. One tap, two tap, Tap and hold. I'm going on vacation next week so that will be the true test. But so far I'm pretty happy with them"
"This is the first set of earbuds I've owned as I've well used some older Bose overear headphones. Out of the box they looked and felt great. The first this I did was connect to my phone and call a friend. He said he could hear me clearly, even in a busy house. I then downloaded the companion Soundcore app and was even more surprised how clean the features were and options for equalizer changes. I've had them for a month and I listen to music or podcasts while doing work, dishes and mowing the lawn. No complaints. The battery life is great and they sound very clear. The equalizer is probably best for certain types of music but I left it Soundcore default and have had no issues. Super durable and can't beat the price!"
"Wow. I'm so compelled to leave a good review because it is surpringly excellent!

I love the sound quality. Canf find difference (in terms of pleasant with the sound quality) with my bose Headphone.

Also, the app control is extremly useful. Why? Because I want to avoid unncessary call or controll by accidently touching ear buds. I can aboid this by changing contol setting in app. Samsung galaxy buds offer this, im surprised that this earbuds with 24 dollars can offer this.

Kudos to Soundcore. Just keep the price.

I highly recommend this product to everyone."
"The sound is general es very good, have a really good battery and the case is small and practical, in order to achieve the maximum potential you must to install the soundcore app which have some really good options life the EQs profiles and the option to change the touch controls, also I loved the find the earphones function, again only available with the app.

The back draws for me are the touch controls, seriously even with the option of the customization are really bad and you aren't enable to use the controls if you only are using one earbud, the other back draw for me was the pads, a little uncomfortable.

But again I bought this for 20 bucks so you cannot ask for the heaven"
"I've been looking to buy more good earbuds without spending a ton of money. I've already got some Nothing earbuds, their first ones, and they are excellent and I have an ancient pair of Soundcore Life P2s, also excellent after several years. I tried a $20 set of Ear Candy's and was disappointed by the build and the sound. Then I ordered these. They won't be mistaken for the much more expensive models, the sound is not as good, but for $20 they are a great value. Build quality far better than the price suggests, and the sound is very good on their own. In direct comparison with more expensive models, the difference shows, but on their own they won't disappoint."
"I got these on sale for $20 and I love them. The audio sounds great. The bass is superb, and that's coming from a guy that likes a big bass. The app that allows you to adjust the headphones is also a nice touch. I'll use it to give the bass an extra boost. The connection is stable, my last pair would constantly cut in and out when I was connected to my laptop. I swapped out the tips for a medium one, and they fit perfectly and cut out almost all background noise.

All in all, you can't go wrong with these headphones."
"These Soundcore by Anker P20i True Wireless Earbuds are not just a pretty pair in that gorgeous pink color—they seriously pack a punch! With 10mm drivers delivering big bass, the sound quality is incredible, and the noise cancellation is top-notch, especially considering the price. The Bluetooth 5.3 connection is super reliable, and the 30 hours of playtime means I can enjoy my music all day long without having to recharge. The customizable 22 preset EQs let me tweak the sound exactly how I like it, and the 2 AI-enhanced mics make calls crystal clear. Plus, they’re water-resistant, so they’re perfect for workouts or rainy days. These earbuds are the total package—both stylish and powerful!"
"Another one for soundcore. This is my 4 th sound core product and once again there was no disappointment. I use the app which I love and carries over from precious products that I have purchased from the already. This is the p20 and 30i side by side for comparison. Noticed everything is pretty much the same size wise. Sound wise though if definitely different. Which makes it seem more involved when setting up the eq, since I prefer bass and need to make it up in the adjustments. I just ordered some memory foam tips so I will update th8s with the ones I get and how they work. Definitely would recommend over any other similar brands I have puchased including the nonsound cancelling beats or first iterations of the air pods. More to come. Also with everything being said I would get the 30s overt the 20s but if you are looking to save the money I would sweat the difference, the 20s are still an amazing deal. Cheers!!"
"Update: The vendor spontaneously reached out to me and offered a full refund, surprisingly WITHOUT asking me to edit my review. 5 stars for customer service, I'm bumping my review up one star. The buds sound fine, with the functional limitations noted below that make them less optimal to me, but might be OK with you. (I actually found that my old style -Life P2- are still available, and just purchased a pair: i like the brand, and the customer service appears second to none!)

Over the years, i've purchased 5 pairs of Soundcore BT earbuds, and have managed to lose all of them, save one last survivor. I really like my old ones, but they're not available anymore, so I bought these new ones, trusting they would be as good if not better... wrong. The sound is fine (especially since i mostly listen to audiobooks), they fit as well as the old model, and i can use only one individually, to effectively double my listen time when away for charging options. But --
a) the ""tap"" controls are awful: it takes me dozens of tries to get my book or music to pause, or start again,
b) there's no way to completely turn them off without placing them back in the charging station. I used to just take one bud with me, drive or bike to work or wherever, just turned it off with one long press on the control button when arrived at my destination, and turn them back one a few hours later when heading home with still lots of battery left: not possible anymore unless i pack the charging pod with me, an unnecessary & PITA step.
c) i've used them for over a week now, and i've had _several_ instances of them connecting to my phone when the buds are stored in the charging pod... :-|
So -- good buds for the price, but be aware of those 3 backwards limitations, if they matter to you as they do to me. I bought 2 pairs, knowing i'm going to misplace some of the buds soon, but will return one pair and look for another alternative: i can live with remembering to take the charging pod everywhere i go, but the lackluster pause function and random connections are very frustrating."
"Really enjoy these and on my second pair. Sound is good and microphone seems to be OK so for on the few calls i've had. Lost my first batch on a trip, but for the price really not an issue getting another pair. Down one star as touch control can be a little unresponsive at times, but not a big deal to me. I did like the mechanical button version I had lost as it never had any touch response issues. Again a great item for the price."
"I got them to listen to audio books and pod casts on my I phone and they are great for that. I haven’t figured out how to use them for a phone call, I think I just haven’t figured out how to use them for a call. It isn’t obvious like I expected but a great price for what I got them for. The sound is great and they fit comfortably. If I could get them to work for phone calls it would be 5 stars!"
What I like about this product is that I can actually hear the other person well on phone calls as well as them hearing me. This was the reason I decided to ditch my jbl and use these easy to use headphones that have a good quality sound. I love the color and the fact it's easily portable so you can take it anywhere. They give you a few ear buds to fit perfectly in your ear to keep it stable and not constantly falling out.
"These headphones both look and sound great. They are a bit larger than expected but mostly do a solid job of staying in your ear once the right sized earpiece for you is found. The only real issue I seem to have with these is the Bluetooth seems to struggle with maintaining a proper connection at times. Even when just taking a walk, I briefly lose connection when slipping the phone into my pocket. It will eventually maintain the connection but only after the connection breaking up for a brief moment. Not deal breaking at all but certainly a bit annoying.

All in all, Soundcore tends to be a brand I trust.
Quality and affordable audio technology when you need it. I've purchased a more expensive brand previously which died on my in a matter of months, leading to me to replace it with these. Should any issues arise, I will follow up and update this review."
"The tracking feature is not like find my, I was pretty much just looking for that but I got this instead. The earphones are nice but I just wish the app really did smth it really just does nothing. The tracking feature doesn’t work if it’s not connect already and it can be used as the same effect playing a sound in YouTube. It came attached with a lanyard so that was very nice and the earphone is good it’s just the app was pretty much useless."
"I bought these to replace my Sennheiser CX True Wireless (dreaded right-bud failure many experienced, don't buy!) -- and I got the P20i on sale for $20. I use them for audiobooks and casual music listening while doing chores. For the price, they are satisfying. They are not great, and IMO, you should not believe reports that they ""sound as good as $100 earbuds"", they don't (again, IMO).

The app is pretty solid and has a page that allows you to change what each touch-press does, independent for each side, so I was able to set them up to behave the way I was used to with my Senns.

Overall, they are worth the price, especially when on sale for $20, where they are a darn good value."
"I have Apple AirPods, AirPods Pro and the Beats kind for exercising. I have been ultimately disappointed with all of them for either comfort or sound issues. I thought I'd go the other direction and try something cheap. I'm more happy with overall than any of the other ones mentioned. Lightweight and plastic, but so what? Very comfortable and surprisingly good. I suggest to anyone to try them out and see if they are good enough for you , before spending a bunch of money."
"I've tried out a good number of ear buds and so far, these have been worth their weight in gold! Affordable but with some of the highest quality sound you can imagine. I bought a pair of JBL buds that were about twice as expensive and they can't even dream of comparing to these! They last a good while on a single charge, too. If you're on or off a budget, get these. Please. Seriously save yourself the time and hassle of trying out different ones like I did. Sure they might be a tad bulky, but they stay in without issue and I wear them while working and moving around a lot. I haven't worn them while doing a full workout, but I can't imagine I'd have any issues with them."
"These headphones have great sound and amazing bass. They connect well with my phone and my smart watch. They do a pretty good job of blocking background noise even without ANC. I wear them mostly while mowing and don't always hear the lawn mower. I haven't used the app much, I used it just to set the equalizer how I wanted and change some of the touch functions. Battery life is pretty good, I can wear them for a few hours straight while doing yard work over the course of a couple days before I need to charge them"
"Probably the best sounding, most reliable set of wireless earbuds I have ever used. I figured they would be good quality coming from Anker, but I didn’t expect them to be this good for the price. What a great surprise to find out how good they are - would have easily spent $50 on these and been satisfied with quality, amazing buy for $20! Excellent charging case, super reliable connectivity, awesome battery life and amazing sound! Anker is quality!"
"My 12 year old really wanted a pair of Bluetooth earbuds and I bought these for her a few months ago. I didn’t want to spend much since they are small and would likely get lost. Last night my daughter was doing her laundry and realized she left one of the earbuds in her pocket and it went through the washer AND dryer. I assumed they would be toast, but she put them back in the case and they are working just fine."
"For $20, I think these are good value. I like anker and soundcore as a brand, and own an over the ear pair of headphones from them as well.

Pros:
- compact case with strap
- aesthetically pleasing
- acceptable audio quality
- compatible with soundcore app
- good battery life

Cons:
- sometimes randomly connect to my phone while in case or don't disconnect when I put them in

that's it really. it's pretty solid, but I'm disappointed in the disconnection issue as it was something I was looking to improve from my pair of tozo earbuds."
"I bought these ear buds for the sole purpose of finding some comfortable ear buds to wear under my motorcycle helmet. The comfort is great and the sound is very good. The first ride, the right side would cut out, and this happened 6 times in a 60 minute ride. The next ride it did it did not cut out at all. I hope it was a glitch when I first used them with a full charge. I will have to do another review when I go on a 6-8 hour ride. This is the only reason for the 4 stars."
"I have to take a few minutes to leave this review because the headphones truly deserve it. First of all, I am an audiophile and my judgment of sound quality is very critical. I was hesitant about these headphones at first because of how cheap they are. As I am reviewing them here now, I am letting you know because the quality is truly unbeatable. Let no one hesitate for a second to buy them. You will not find better ones."
"Earbuds are one of those tech items that I frequently seem to misplace or lose to sticky fingered coworkers. I am not enough of an audiophile to justify spending a bunch of money on them, especially given their tendency to disappear.
These Anker P20i earbuds are - for me - the perfect earbud. They sound really good, pair immediately with iPhone, and are inexpensive enough that if they do disappear I don't go full-on Hulk rage. The Anker app is also great. I have owned the Apple, JBL, Bose, Beats, and others, but I can't imagine buying anything other than Anker going forward. Try them for yourself and you will be a convert, too."
"I buy new ear buds every 3 months to use at work, because I always lose one. These are by far the best set I've tried, and I've tried em all. They connect quickly, even when only using 1 headphone. They fit perfectly and don't fall out. The charge case is small and fits comfortably in my pocket. The base and overall sound quality is great. My favorite part, is the pause feature has a 2 tap, so I don't accidentally pause my music or podcast. I will be buying this set every time from now on."
"Great pair of Bluetooth headphones. I like everything about these. From the connection, the sounds it makes before/after pairing. I love the color of these too. Fit perfectly in my ears.

What I REALLY like is the sound/bass, and all the customization/equalizer from the app. The app is great, and you can tell this company really wants to cater to the customer.

Extremely satisfied, I would use this brand/model for gift ideas or myself again.

Great buy 👍🏼"
These buds are priced right at 20 dollars. They are comfortable. Light weight. The color us what u order..Best part of these is battery life I cannot believe they last me over a week one one charge! I've bought way higher priced in past any only ever have gotten one days worth if that. Only con is they aren't noise canceling but again for price point thata ok..for 20 dollars more u can upgrade and get those if u wanna
"I've been looking for a reasonably priced set of earbuds that have a lot of bass. THESE ARE THE BEST!!! They don't hurt my ears. They fit well. I don't wear them during exercise, so can't say if they stay put. They do have some that wrap around the ear for that I think. I don't like tap functions, so use the app to turn all that off. They block outside noise very well. I LOVE 'EM!!! Thank YOU Soundcore!!! 🔊🔊🔊🔊❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"Worked fine for six months so gets one star. From a very good brand name so gets another star. Then, after six months, it stopped working. Four different devices of mine could not longer ""find"" these earbuds via Bluetooth. Initially I gave the earbuds two starsbin this review due to this failure. Anker saw this review and offered me a full refund. So now I'm at four stars, because Anker reads reviews and addresses problems. I have many Anker products and this is the first issue I've had with any of them."
"The customer service is top notch. After they saw my review they reached out to me to help me. I can say that they helped in every way and I very professional. We still could not get my microphone to work, so I was offered to return for a new pair. I'm very happy!! This was all done with them reaching out to me, not me rescuing out too them. I guess the old saying you get what you paid for. I realize these are not high quality earbuds. I can hear people just fine, but the person I am talking with say it sounds like I'm very far away, I'm hard to hear even with their volume turned all the way up. I've tried all the troubleshooting suggestions but nothing seems to work. Bummer!!"
"After finally deciding to get wireless earbuds for work I found this on sale and I gotta say this buds don't disappoint its a must get and I will continue to get their brand for how good they are. Battery life has last me for my 8hour shifts.

The cool thing about this earbuds it's that when one bud is on the case it goes into single bud mode, sound is great clear voice and nice bass."
"The speakers on this headset have excellent sound quality, it supports the AAC codec for HD Bluetooth audio, it does not support Qualcomm Apt-x. AAC Bluetooth Audio is primarily supported by iPhone but it also works on Android and PC.

The headset comes with several ear tips so you can get the right fit for your ear canal, and it is the most comfortable cheap set of earbuds I've ever worn, most cheap sets have some sort of plastic projection that hurts after you wear it for a couple hours. I hooked these to my computer for gaming and played for hours, no pain whatsoever.

It has excellent battery life and case charges fairly quickly. On the whole this is an excellent headset, considering the price it was a steal."
"The headphones are amazing. The Bluetooth stretches very far, and the app is nice, to find them.

I do wish there was an offline finding or precision finding, but for $20, this is A M A Z I N The headphones are amazing! The Bluetooth range is very impressive, and the app is easy to use to locate them.

I wish there were an offline or more precise finding feature, but for $20, this is amazing!"
Got these as a substitute for my Airpods as I was traveling to Mt. Kilimanjaro and didn’t want my AirPods to get damaged. These worked amazingly and kept the charge for over a week. The sound quality is pretty good. They are a little looser than my AirPods and fall out easier if caught on my hair but it wasn’t a big issue. They also connect easily and are a great alternative for the price.
"For $20 I’d say you’d be hard pressed to find a much better product. I like the fit of them and they hold comfortably in my ears without feeling like they’ll fall out.

Has good High and lows but missing the mids. I had a pair of Tozo Crystal buds and those had a slightly better sound but they cost nearly double this price and always fall out of my ears randomly.

I used to not be a fan of pencil style buds but these are comfortable and have a great sound."
"Decent quality wireless earbuds. Gets the job done. Sound quality is good for music listeners. Companion app great for finding them when they are misplaced. If you are someone who sleeps with them on like me, you’ll find that the battery life lasts all night, so when they inevitably fall out, you can still find them! Definitely would recommend for those who are tight on money and looking for an alternative to more expensive wireless earbuds."
"I bought a pair for my son due to the upcoming school year. Tried them out of curiosity, and was shocked at how great the sound was AND for only $20! Bought another immediately to be used as a spare when I don’t want to use my expensive AirPod Pro’s when playing my Steam Deck.

Insane how far technology has come. I’ve always been a huge fan of Anker products for years now and they continue to always be my default for both performance to price ratio.

These buds look, feel, fit, bass and sound great. They do not sound nor look cheap IMO. I would say these rival the AirPods (Non-Pro) from the perspective of a non-audiophile individual. I do not care about the lack of ANC or Transparency mode for this. I have my AirPods for that. A bonus is how these can be used with the Anker Soundcore app to modify the sound equality.

Worth it. I highly recommend if you are looking for something that is affordable without sounding like crap.

Note: Didn’t use the mic, but I’m sure it’s decent and more than enough for your basic needs."
"I got two pairs of these Soundcore P20i earbuds for my sons (10 and 12) to use with their laptops and iPads during homeschool, and they’ve been fantastic! The sound quality is top-notch, and the earbuds hold up beautifully even with daily use. We’ve always been fans of Anker products, and these earbuds definitely live up to the brand’s reputation.

They’re comfy, reliable, and work seamlessly with all our devices. I’m so impressed that I’m planning to grab a few more pairs to give as gifts for friends and family this holiday season. If you’re looking for high-quality, affordable earbuds, these are a great choice!"
"Great sound with incredible battery life. I generally use only one earbud at a time, so my listening time is effectively doubled on top of the naturally long battery life of each earbud. Then you add in the whole charging case, and I typically only have to charge these earbuds every 3 or 4 days.

The find missing earbud feature is absolutely a must. I can't tell you how grateful I am to have found my missing one laying in the yard, in the middle of the night."
"I am extremely satisfied with my Soundcore earbuds! I recently had a minor accident where they fell into water, but to my surprise, they continued to work flawlessly afterward. The durability is impressive. Additionally, the battery life is outstanding—lasting well beyond what I expected. The sound quality remains top-notch, making every listening experience enjoyable. I’m very happy with this purchase and highly recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for reliable, high-quality audio gear."
"I recently tried out these earbuds after I accidentally put my last pair through the washing machine. These earbuds deliver outstanding sound quality and the directions were simple and easy to understand. The audio experience is great to use for listening to music. While outdoor running, there was still enough sound breakthrough that I could hear environmental factors around me for safety.

However, there’s a notable caveat for those with smaller ears. The fit might be a bit cumbersome, as the earbuds tend to be on the larger side. I found that they didn’t sit as snugly in my ears as I’d hoped, which isn’t uncommon for smaller ears. When it comes to using them during workouts, they shine during indoor strength training. They stay relatively secure and provide an excellent soundtrack to your exercise routine. But for outdoor running or high-impact sports, I’d recommend looking for something more compact and stable. The larger size and fit issues might cause them to fall out or need to be readjusted frequently.

Overall, I’m happy with the purchase but might look for something different for high impact sports."
I bought these to replace an inexpensive pair that were not holding a charge and am very happy with the comfort and sound quality. I am not an audiophile! I especially liked the 22 equalizer settings in the app. I’ve only used them for a few hours so cannot attest to the battery life. I primarily listen to audiobooks and podcasts but do listen to music also and the sound is clear.
"Overall, I am pleased with the quality of these. I listen to a lot of podcasts and audiobooks primarily, and use these to listen while I am outside mowing, gardening, and doing other work around the house. I don't need super high quality to listen to spoken word but I have listened to music with them and can say that they are good quality for the price! Also used them for phone calls, and was told that I sounded good on the other person's end. The form factor is great and fits in your pocket perfectly. I have been using them for a couple of months with no problems until recently Just the other day, they now seem to be randomly connecting to my phone when they are in their case (even with the case closed). When you put them in the case they turn off, but randomly (sometimes hours later) they will reconnect to my phone, hence subtracting a star from my rating. They do come with three sizes of earbuds to accommodate various people. I tried them all and they will still fall out when I am sweating or when talking or eating/chewing. But I feel like that is more of a ""me"" problem. Overall I would recommend them. I have other Anker products and have had no problems with any, up until now (and the connecting to phone when in case is really more of an inconvenience than anything else)."
"Update (8/5/2024):

Seller reached out to troubleshoot, and replaced the product. New one is working well. Will update again if that changes. Changed number of stars from one to four based on teh facty that the seller resolved the issue I had.

Original text (07/20/2024):

They worked for a while. Then the left earbud stopped working: No sound, and the reset procedure (holding the inside and outside of the earbud for 10 seconds) does not work.

The web site gives the following instructions:

""""""
- Take the earbuds out of the charging case, and wear the earbuds, while long pressing the left and right earbuds 10S, hear a beep, indicating a successful reset.
""""""

Took a while to figure out that this means ""touch the inside and outside of the stem of each bud for 10 seconds"". But only the working bud beeps.

Amazon support page has a link to the manufacturer. That link doesn't work: I get a 404 (page not found) error."
"I am a musician, and I listen to music all day everyday.

I was immediately Blown Away by the heavy low end and bass offered by these headphones.

They don't feel cheap, they immediately felt comfortable, and the noise canceling is incredible.

As a person who uses high quality studio monitors and headphones for recording purposes, these hold up incredibly well.

Luckily I got these half price!"
"I recommend these earbuds and they bought them as well. You get quality sound, the battery lasts longer than expected. They connect easily to my Google phone and my laptop. The case they come in is very sturdy since I have drop them before and they charge rapidly. I will be using these ones instead pixel buds or any other ones that are more expensive. 10/10 buy for me."
"So far, I totally love these! I got the blue ones and the color is just beautiful. The case is nice and small. The ear buds do not fall out and stay in place nicely so far. And they don't hurt my ears. They connect to the phone super fast. The sound is amazing! It's clear, crisp, and there's no high pitched sounds. I really love the Soundcore app! The fact I can adjust one tap, two taps or no tap on the buds is sweet.
I'm gonna give these a few weeks and update. But so far, I totally recommend!"
"I loved these earbuds, I purchased them 6 weeks ago and have used them consistently but this past week, they would only connect if I ""forgot"" the connection and freshly repaired my device everytime I used them. Now they will not pair at all. I have tried 3 different devices and it's all the same. I am two weeks past the return date so unfortunately these will be going in the trash."
"Flawless user interface wise - I don't have to fiddle with pairing them ever (aside from the first time - which was easy), they just work. They don't drop out fully if I get far enough away that the signal starts to sputter, and they auto reconnect quickly. Charging is very simple, carrying case is great. Volume is excellent for the size and easily drowns out my coworkers music that I don't like when I want it to. Comfortable too. Battery life is great, I've used them for hours at a time with the volume up high, not sure exactly how long but probably 4 to 6 hours if I had to guess. I'd buy these again in a heartbeat."
"It's my first pair of wireless earbuds! Shocking I know but I have have a have corded pair for the gym and occasionally wear corded old school ones around the house.
I love these BUT I've only had them for a week. They didn't fall out in the weight room. Sounded good when on calls and were great when I went for a walk.
Battery life seems good so far and I have a habit of wearing one and there was no problem.
I'd definitely recommend"
"I have had several different ear buds and bone conduction headphones. These work great, don't have touch sensors to adjust settings, unless you want to have them. The app can so adjustment on the fly. or you can make touch settings available if you'd like. Great sound, especially with extra base turned on. Very comfortable even while sleeping. Great run time on a single charge."
"Play Video
Looks good, secure in case, easy to grab and go, good sound, and fits in my ears. There are bud options for different ear sizes. Both buds are independent, so you can use either solo and there is no lag when you case one and not the other.

Worst part are the controls. They just had to be different. Instead of using the tried and true (one touch answer/hang up/pause/play, two touch skip, three touch back.) They use a ridiculous one touch answer/hang up, two touch play/pause, long hold right skip, long hold left back.

So there is a delay in the touch. Like a half second. It's like touch-pause-beep. So if you just want to play music you can't touch before the beep or it won't read. Example, if you go touch-touch-beep, it will register as one touch. But you can't be too slow, if you wait and go touch beep touch beep, it may register as one and one (not two together). So you have to practice the timing to get it to touch beep/touch beep. Was this annoying to read? Wait til you do it.

So the long press skip/back. Sometimes I'm rocking out and someone talks to me, so I pop one out in my hand and leave the other in. Well, holding it may register as a long touch so while you're talking, the song is skipping in your ear. Guys - this doesn't need to be like this. Just copy bose and get it right.

If you're reading this far and thinking ""I don't care about all this"", then these are 5 star buds. Also, it only took me a day to learn the timing, so not too bad. I wanted CHEAP buds that play well and don't lose connection easily and that's what I got. If that's what you want then these are them."
"I bought these to have some cheap, whatever earbuds for work. I didn’t expect anything special. I’m very impressed!

The noise cancelling is decent, the ear fitment is pretty good, the sound is good for my needs, and the pairing is completely seamless. I regularly swap these between 3 different devices and it never has issue. I always had problems switching devices with my partner’s apple products, so the pairing ease was a particular joy to discover.

Unbeatable value for the price. If you just want something that’ll do the job, this is what to buy."
"I am a big fan of Anker and all the products. I use their cables, battery packs, Bluetooth speakers and their security system (Eufy), I finally bought their ear buds.. Incredible affordable and the sound is the best of all my earbuds. Big bass, I always recommend using an EQ app to dial any ""sounding"" product. great mids and not too harsh highs either!! buy buy buy!!!"
"These sound great but find that if you don't keep them pushed in tight, they fall out.
Had it happened to me while I was on a ladder. Was able to retrieve the one that fell out. It still works ok.
Remember to keep them tight.
Still trying to get the touch controls to work the way I want them. Will keep working on it."
"I wanted a set of earbuds just for running with my Apple Watch instead of my AirPods due to constant issues with phone and watch conflicts. Now, I roll out as these are not connected to my phone, just the watch. These fit the bill and I have come to always look for Anker products first when in need. They don’t disappoint with quality and value. Easily recommend these."
"I may be a bit biased since these are my very first ear buds ever and I'm 53 yrs old but these are incredible, all the volume, acoustics, bass, rhythm your ears could want plus the longevity of how far you can go, if your phone can go there so can the ear buds and 10 hours on a full charge is pretty awesome! It is sweat resistant but not water proof so no showers or rain downpours unless ears are covered. Voice calls are crystal clear with no background noise interfering. Easy peasy touch controls for phone and music. Plus you can use just the one ear bud if work or safety is needed/required to pay attention to your surroundings. Also it has voice assistant if you do that kind of thing, too complicated for this old folgy but you do you youngins😊 Oh! Best part is the price!! I got mine on discount but the original price is just $20😱 You can't beat that! These ear buds are worthy of more but so very glad that are priced at $20. Trust this old folgy and get these ear buds!!! You won't be disappointed!!"
"I like them. The sound is decent, thye fit my ears fine. The only issue I have is they lack range. If I am listening to something and walking around in my house, it goes in and out, gets static and cuts out alot. But if I am near the source, like my phone is in my pocket it is great. So they arent bad for the price. If I paid more, I'd expect them to have a little better range than these."
"I broke my google buds on accident and bought these as a quick cheap replacement. The sound profile is a bit different from the pixel buds, bass is a little heavier imo but other sound isn't as well balanced. They stay in my ears well. Overall quality seems a bit cheaper than the pixel buds but at $20 I can't complain. Long battery life and they work well."
Purchased these for my son. They were easy to pair to multiple devices. Only complaint is that even though they are not noise cancelling and we have volume limits set on his devices he has trouble hearing if we talk to us when wearing. While this might not be a bad thing for most I wanted him to be able to hear his surroundings while wearing.
"No se puede pedir mas por el precio,son bastante livianos, parecen ser como cualquiera, pero una vez los enciendes y los pruebas te llevas una enorme sorpresa, lo que mas me gustó fue el bajo, es super potente,suenan fuerte y con una calidad de sonido bastante decente, superaron mis espectativas,si quieres disfrutar de tu musica a altp volumen y calidad y no deseas pagar demasiado estos son los indicados,mejores que muchos audifonos de 60 y 100 usd"
"First impressions, $20!! Never buying expensive again. These sound very loud and have heavy but muddy base. Sound quality is not the best, but whoa. $20!! No transparency or anc. Should have went with a higher model up for transparency. Touch controls take some getting used to and app connection is never maintained. Fit, so far is good. Not for exercising though. Recommended."
"Would be 5 stars if the first pair worked but they made things good so still a solid 4.

Left ear of first pair had no sound. Would issue commands for next or last track but no beeps or music. I work in IT and tried everything with no luck. Replacement arrived the next day and worked perfectly out of the box. I think these may be on a reduced price because of quality issues. Lesson is, if you can't get it to work it is probably broken and not you. I would def buy again from them."
I needed to get earbuds for work due to the fact they won’t let me wear my full size headphones I’m really not a fan of earbuds because I lose them and it used to be you had to spend 100+ to get a pair that sounds decent but these were even better then my jabras at a fraction of the price even better then my AirPods and the best part is if I lose them I’ll only be upset I can’t listen to music for the rest of the day this is perfect if your like me and have a hard time keeping track of earbuds can’t beat anker.
"I was having trouble with my Samsung earbuds. The sound would cut out if I had my phone on a pocket or against my body. I understand this is common. But these earbuds don't have that interference. I am so happy about this!

I haven't gotten the tapping gestures down yet for skipping or pausing the music. But. Hopefully soon."
"While the audio could be better (I mostly listen to podcasts or YouTube videos while I work so it's no big deal for me), these headphones last forever when it comes to battery life. Most earbuds I have to switch out every 2 or 3 hours. These last a half day or more. I would buy again, especially for the price."
"Bought this to strictly keep in my gym bag. I use samsung earbuds primarily at work and these being WAY cheaper still sound really good for the price. Battery life is pretty damn good, they recharge really fast in case. The eq function is super simple and straight forward. Only thing i'm not a fan of is how cheap the case feels."
"I use earbuds and earphones for one reason only -- music. I care about sound quality period. I don't care about NC or water resistance or phone clarity. Just sound, and comfort is a bonus. These are fabulous. I have listened to music through these that I have listened to for years and years and these buds brought forward some facets of that music that I had never heard. There was more ""stuff"" that came forward from the shadows I never knew was there. I'm not an audiophile so don't ask me for the ""proper"" descriptive terminology, but these have several layers of bass, vocals are balanced and clear, there is appreciable separation, and surprising airy sound stage. I'm not into Rap, heavy metal or jazz. I listen mostly to oldie jams, classic orchestral, choral, gospel and some ethnic music. I have only one complaint and that is connectivity. You can only connect them to one device at a time and you cannot wander too from the device. Still worth the price though. Buy them, it is money well spent. You will not regret it"
"Never have much luck with earbuds but these are very comfortable with decent sound quality. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the range seems to be a little limited. For walking, TV etc. they are just fine. They also live up to their advertised play time and they charge quickly in both the case and when hooked to the computer."
I have to say I was a little skeptical of the quality given the low price. I was wrong these are an amazing value for the price. The bass was deep and actually surprised me. The battery lasted all day at work and the mic during a phone call sounded clear. My old headphones people used to say I sounded low but not on these.
"I wanted a pair of inexpensive earbuds for use while exercising. These fit the bill nicely. Paired easily with my iPhone 15. Much better sound quality than the previous economy earbuds I had. Good noise reduction as well. If you're looking for something inexpensive with decent sound and don't want to do a lot of research, just hit that ""Add to Cart"" and get these."
"There are obviously a million different options for Bluetooth headphones on Amazon so why should you chose these?

There are three things that tend to set the Tagry X88s apart from other options:

1) I have quite a few pairs of BT headphones of different styles (I tend to misplace them) and have found the sound quality with these to be on par with far more expensive options - which is to say the sound is excellent. Many of the budget models provide a passable at best sound quality without any real depth or crispness. The X88s provide a great range of sound that is clear and nuanced. I listen to a lot of music as well as audiobooks and do so in many different enviroments. The spoken word is very clear and the music has breadth and depth. The level of sound can be adjusted to offset background noise in places like the gym or near a busy road. This sets puts them in a unique lower-cost but high quality category.

2) You can tell Tagry put some thought behind the design. They are comfortable on your ears, they are light (even with the long battery life), they are durable, and the sound/phone controls are intuitive. The left and right buttons have different functions and so you have to read the well-layed-out manual, but after committing the simple instructions to memory (which are very simple), you can replicate all the functions you have on the source of the sound. For me (and most people) this would be your phone. Increase/decrease volume, next song, last song, pause, answer call, hang up, initiate a Siri or Google Assistant request - it's all available with the left and right buttons on the buds.

3) There are few things as frustrating (maybe a bit of an overstatement but...) as having your headphones die in the middle of a workout or while you are in the middle of a phone conversation. The X88s, by virtue of their super long battery life, make this an almost impossibility. Sure, if you don't charge them for ever, they are going to die at some point, but most of us are displicined enough to get them back to their charging case at regular intervals and since they last for hours on a charge, it's unlikely you'll have to contend with the devilish voice announcing 'low battery' and wrecking your work out or work or fun.

At the end of the day (and I wish it was cuz I am hankering for a beer), I would recommend these as a very affordable but very high quality option setting it apart from the myriad other options."
"I've recently purchased my third pair of Tagry wireless earbuds, and I just had to share my experience. I first bought these earbuds because of the amazing price and the glowing reviews, and let me tell you, they did not disappoint! I was so impressed that I ended up getting a second pair as a gift for my mom. And now, I've got the Tagry X88 earbuds, so I can have one pair at home and one in my briefcase for when I'm on the move.

So, what keeps me coming back to Tagry earbuds? First off, the battery life is unreal. With 80 hours of playtime, I never have to worry about my earbuds dying on me in the middle of the day. Plus, the LED display on the charging case is super handy for keeping an eye on the battery level.

The Bluetooth 5.4 technology makes pairing with my phone a breeze, and the one-button control on the earbud is really convenient for managing my music and calls. And can we talk about the sound quality? It's seriously impressive - crystal clear audio and powerful bass that makes my music come to life.

But here's the kicker: these earbuds are insanely comfortable. The soft earhooks keep them securely in place, even during my toughest workouts. And with the IPX7 waterproof rating, I don't have to worry about sweat or rain ruining them.

I've put these earbuds through their paces, and they've never let me down. For the price, the Tagry wireless earbuds are an absolute steal. If you're looking for a reliable, high-quality pair of earbuds that won't break the bank, I highly recommend giving Tagry a try. Trust me, once you experience them for yourself, you'll be hooked! 🎧💯"
"Tagry X88 Ear Buds
This product speaks for itself...sound quality is superior, blocking outside noise, feels like listening to surround sound. Absolutely love the case..beautiful color, design and solid. Outside display easy to read charge percentage and locate charge port. Inside perfect fitting heart shape and detail product information.
I previously purchased tagry XO8 and has been great thus far when this product came out I was absolutely thrilled to try them.
I have been using these earbuds now for 5days and cannot say enough about it. Great value with superior performance!! Best engineered ear Buds by Tagry thus far👏👏"
"Best Wireless Earbuds by Far
I received my Tagry X88 earbuds today in the mail from Amazon. My first impression is that they are easy to take in and out of the case, which by the way came fully charged with all the accessories. The next thing of course is that I tried them on and I was very impressed. First, they are the most comfortable earbuds I've ever owned. Second, I was concerned that that the over-the-ear earbuds would interfere with my glasses and as you can see from the picture they do not. The easy to operate button on each earbud is a definite plus. But best of all they are secure in my ear and I don't have the fear of losing them as I have had with other earbuds. The pairing of these earbuds was fast and simple, not only to my phone, but also my Samsung TV. Regarding the sound quality, I feel the way they sit on my ear provides better noise cancelling and the sound is crisp and clear. I highly recommend these earbuds for their quality and value."
"I go through bluetooth ear buds... its shameful but I am always losing them it seems.

Being hard of hearing, they are essential to me. These new Tagry X88 are some of the best I've ever had!!

Firstly, they have Awesome audio quality! Rich base and crisp high tones. Very natural sounding. The sound quality is more like ear muff style headphones. So natural and clear.

I really like the wrap around the ear style so they are really secure even when outside sweating and working in the sun, they remain in place! 😀

The X88 have one button operation that is very intuitive and super easy to operate - even with dirty hands.

I couldn't be happier. I've spent 4 times as much as these on other earbuds that didn't work any better.

These also have voice confirmation of pairing, connected etc... good clear prompts. Much more helpful than just beeps and tones.

I higky recommend these to anyone looking for a good quality earbud at a reasonable price!!"
"I bought this item because I love the way they look.

They do not disappoint! They connect quickly and have surprisingly great sound! They are not noise reducing, however the earpieces fit so well in my ears that it makes it hard to hear people or noises around me unless my volume is down very low or I take one earbud out of my ear.

I really like the charging indicator on the front. They charge using a USB-C cord (included), the cord charges them fast, they have great sound and functionality. I would buy these again and would absolutely recommend.

Great headphones, super long battery life, quick charge

Noise canceling ✔️
Good quality of music and sound✔️
Battery life ✔️
Design✔️
Easy to pair✔️
Good thing I purchased this 😊✔️✔️✔️"
"Nice, convenient compact case. Great olive green color. Easy setup, paired quickly with phone. Had them operating in a couple of minutes. It comes with 3 sets of eartips. Has a small set that works well with smaller ears.
Sound quality is great, with volume being able to be adjusted by tapping one side for up volume and other side for down volume.
With regular earbuds, I always felt like they could fall out with a slight jar. The X88's, however are different. With the over the ear piece, they are comfortably secured. I feel they will stay in place and will not have to worry about them falling out or off.
We have a long plane ride coming, and these will fill all my needs for listening to music or watching movies.
Overall, very pleased with all aspects. Quality, color, storage, wearability, sound quality, and I forgot to mention, great pricing."
"These are the third set of earbuds I've gotten from Tagry and like the two previous sets, they are great! I am so impressed with the quality of the earbuds at such an affordable price! The manual that comes with the earbuds is easy to understand and syncing to your phone is a breeze.

I like to have several pair of earbuds so that I can have a pair in my car, a pair in my gym bag, a pair in my purse, and a pair in my luggage. In the past, I've been disappointed to discover I forgot my earbuds when I'm ready to listen to music or podcasts while hiking or working out! Not anymore!!

I used these earbuds for over a week so that I could give a good and honest review of them. They are very comfortable in the ear and I like the earpiece that goes over the ear. I wear them while hiking as well as when working in my garden. I don't need to worry about them falling off, even when moving around as the earpiece holds them securely in place.

They were very easy to sync to my Pixel 7 phone and the sound is excellent. I listen to both music and podcast and the sound is clear and crisp. I don't have any trouble understanding The podcast host. The music comes across so well that I have learned that I have been singing the wrong lyrics to some of my oldies songs!

The case is also a charger for the earbuds so it's very convenient when you carry them in your purse. I can get several full charges on the earbuds before needing to plug the case in. And since the case shows me the percentage of battery remaining, I just plugged them in when they get low and then put them back in my purse. The case is small and does not take up much room so they are perfect for a purse, backpack or a pocket.

The earbuds are very easy to control. Also. You can answer a phone, pause, control the volume, and other options simply by pushing the button on either the left or the right earbud.

I've been using Tagry earbuds for several years now, so I know that the durability and life of the
Is brand of earbuds is excellent."

The primary advantage of using wireless Bluetooth earbuds lies in the unparalleled freedom of movement they offer. Throughout my experience with these earbuds, I noticed that I was able to seamlessly transition between different activities without any restrictions imposed by wires. This made them an ideal choice for a wide range of activities, including workouts, commuting, and everyday tasks. I was particularly impressed by the consistent reliability of the Bluetooth connectivity, as I rarely encountered any dropouts or interruptions while using the earbuds. This uninterrupted connection significantly enhanced my overall experience with the earbuds and contributed to a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
The earbuds come with touch controls that make it effortless to adjust the volume, skip tracks, and handle incoming calls without the need to pull out my phone. I found the touch controls to be highly intuitive, contributing to an overall smooth and hassle-free user experience.
Battery life is always a concern with wireless earbuds, but I was pleasantly surprised by the longevity of these earbuds.

On average, the earbuds lasted several hours on a single charge, which was more than sufficient for my needs.
The earbuds are equipped with comfortable and secure ear hooks that provide added stability during physical activities such as workouts, running, or other sports. Additionally, the earbuds are designed to be waterproof, allowing you to use them in wet or rainy conditions without any concerns.

"I have been using the TAGRY X88 Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds for a couple of days now. Here are my thoughts about them:

Packaging
The item came neatly packaged with clear instructions on how to use and pair the device. The earbuds were fully charged upon arrival. The earbuds were paired without any issue. My device was able to quickly detect them and the notifications in the earbuds helped make it clear that the earbuds were paired. The item also came with a charging cable – USB-C cable. A welcome addition and an unexpected one as well (I’ve had other Bluetooth headsets that didn’t come with any charging cables).
The Instructions were well written and clearly showed how to use the product along with accurate pairing instructions. The instructions also included how to use the headset for phone calls and voice assistant technology.
Overall, I was happy with how the item was packaged and how it looked upon arrival – the charging cable being included was a welcome added bonus as well.

Pros:
-Quality Sound - I've enjoyed the sound that comes from these, I've used them for several hours straight and had no issues with the sound quality. They have delivered high-quality sound including with bass sounds and higher-pitched sounds as well. When using both earbuds it gives a somewhat surround sound feel to it, which is nice. I also found that I did not have to turn my sound up too high to get quality sound – which is a good sign to me that they are delivering quality sound.
-Long Battery Life - I found that these earbuds had a strong battery life, I used them for 4-5 hours at a time and did not get a notification of low battery (it helps that the case has it's own built in battery so you can recharge on the go). The charging cable is USB C which is a nice addition as this charging option is becoming more standard.
-Comfort - These have been fairly comfortable and fit well on my ear. The rubber cover for my ear fits well and I did not notice any issues with them after hours of use.
-Charging - I found that the case quickly charged up and it appears that the battery on the case will last for several recharges of the earbuds before needing to be recharged
-Case/Earbud Quality - The items were of a decent quality and lasted through some rough use from time to time.
-Range - I found that these earbuds had a good range - lasting about 25ft before beginning to fade out and lose the connection (not unsurprising since it's a bluetooth connection)

Cons:
-Case/Earbud Quality - my only issue with the case is that it was made of plastic and didn't have quite the weight I was expecting. The plastic looked like it might not hold up after months of use...but this is fairly minor and overall they have handled well during use.

Overall
I am happy with my purchase and would recommend these earbuds."
"I recently purchased the new TAGRY wireless earbuds, and so far they have exceeded my expectations. They seem high-quality, durable, and are comfortable to wear. The sound quality of the TAGRY earbuds is amazing. Sounds is crystal-clear in the highs and deep in the lows, making listening to music a truly immersive experience. I also like that, unlike other earbuds I’ve had, these are actually effective in blocking out ambient noise. The built-in microphone also ensures that my voice is clear during phone calls. I used the earbuds to make a call in a busy café and my interlocutor had no complaints whatsoever.
Another standout features of these earbuds is the awesome battery life. They promise up to 80 hours of playtime if one uses the case regularly; I have yet to test this claim but it seems I will be able to go days without needing to recharge. This will be great for going to the gym and whenever I am travelling. The LED digital display on the charging case is a handy feature, allowing me to see the remaining battery life at a glance.
Comfort is crucial for me, especially when I’m at the office and during long workout sessions, and these earbuds deliver. I recently took them to the gym. The sleek and modern design of the TAGRY earbuds is both stylish and functional. The compact charging case is easy to carry around, and the earbuds themselves are lightweight and unobtrusive. The earhook design ensures that they stay securely in place, no matter how intense my workout gets (and it can get intense!). The soft silicone material is gentle on my ears, I could wear them for hours without any discomfort. In addition, the earbuds have a great waterproof rating; although I haven’t tested it, if true then this is a big as I’ve had in the past earbuds that have stopped working under the rain.
So far, I also like the Bluetooth, which is stable and fast and has not featured any of the dropouts or lag that you get with lower quality earbuds. Pairing the earbuds with my devices is quick and easy, and the connection remains strong even when I’m moving around. The controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing me to easily adjust the volume, skip tracks, and answer calls with just a tap.
Considering all the features and the exceptional performance, the TAGRY earbuds offer excellent value for money. They are reasonably priced, and the quality is on par with, if not better than, many higher-priced alternatives. I’m assuming I won’t be needing to replace them anytime soon. In a nutshell, these new TAGRY earbuds are an obvious choice for anyone in need of reliable, high-quality wireless earbuds. The impressive battery life, great sound quality, comfortable fit, and ergonomic design make them perfect for basically every listening purpose I can think of. I highly recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for a top-notch audio experience at a reasonable price. Five stars all the way!"
"I had the opportunity to try the Tagry X88 and am enjoying them immensely! There are several different sets that I own and paid about the same as this product but these come up on top.

Connectivity:
Pairing was quick and painless. Placed in my ears, went to my Bluetooth setting and found it quickly and when selected it notified me that it paired. It may seem rather pointless to describe this process but I have a $200 pair that I have to go to my phone, open the Bluetooth settings. Then I open the charging case of those earbuds but not take them out and press a syncing button on the back of that charging case. You then pair the earbuds and if it didn’t connect properly you do this process all over again. Sound great bot NOT FUN!

Comfort:
One of the more surprising aspects of theses earbuds are the comfort. Wasn’t hard to put on, nothing toadjust and had them on for approximately 8 without any discomfort, irritation, etc.

Battery:
As I mention above, these earbuds lasted at least 8 hours while I was working outdoors. The case/charging case has already fully charged the earbuds!

Sound Quality:
The sound to these are good for the price. It provides a full body sound and that’s a good thing. Voice is clear whether listening to music or talking on the phone. I was able to understand what was being said and never felt the need to ask someone to repeat anything. The bass is good on these earbuds. The Mids are a little muddled but for the price I can’t scrutinize them much. What Tagry was able to produce and provide at the this price range is incredible.

Features:
Not too much to say here. To pause and play or pick up and hang up are relatively similar to others on the market.

Conclusion:
You can’t go wrong for the price. Whether you prefer to use these as your main pair or as an alternative. Regardless, if your personal needs, you should feel satisfied when using these!"

The earbuds fit snugly into the ear, ensuring a secure and comfortable listening experience, even during intense workouts or long commutes.

The long battery life ensures that you can enjoy your music for hours without worrying about running out of juice.

"I recently purchased the Tagry X88 earbuds, and I am absolutely thrilled with my experience. These earbuds have exceeded my expectations in every way, making them a fantastic addition to my daily routine.

First and foremost, the sound quality is exceptional. The Tagry X88 earbuds deliver crystal-clear audio with a perfect balance of bass, mids, and highs. Whether I’m listening to my favorite music, podcasts, or taking calls, the sound is consistently impressive. The 13mm drivers ensure powerful bass and clear treble, making every listening experience enjoyable1.

Comfort is key when it comes to earbuds, and the Tagry X88 does not disappoint. The earbuds are lightweight and come with three different ear tip sizes, ensuring a secure and comfortable fit for any ear shape. I can wear them for hours without any discomfort, even during intense workout sessions. The IPX7 water resistance rating means they can handle sweat and rain, making them perfect for outdoor activities2.

Pairing the earbuds with my devices was a breeze, thanks to the Bluetooth 5.3 technology. The connection is stable and reliable, with no noticeable lag or dropouts. The touch controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing me to easily manage my music and calls without reaching for my phone2.

One of the features I appreciate the most is the built-in microphone with CVC noise reduction. It ensures that my voice comes through clearly during calls, even in noisy environments. This has been a game-changer for me, especially during work calls and virtual meetings1.

In conclusion, the Tagry X88 earbuds offer outstanding value for their price. They combine excellent sound quality, impressive battery life, comfortable fit, and reliable connectivity into a sleek and stylish package. I highly recommend these earbuds to anyone in need of high-quality, affordable wireless earbuds. They have truly enhanced my listening experience and daily activities."
"For starters I really like how the ear pieces are super flexible. They connect to your phone super easily in the beginning while they also reconnect themselves if you get too far from your phone. I like the different controls the buttons have. It definitely makes it easy to leave your phone in your pocket or on the charger but still use them and change songs or something. I wore them while I cooked at a camp this weekend so it definitely made using them a lot more convenient and not having to go to my phone every time I wanted to change a song or something made life way easier. Over the 12 hours of cooking cleaning and doing all the moving around a cook at a camp does they stayed put completely. I did have a small break in the middle of the day so I am not sure how long the headphones last until they die but I do know after charging the headphones twice a day all three days, I never had to recharge my case over the whole three days. The headphones never died or even got close to dying and the case still isn't dead after the camp is over and the headphones are fully charged again. Regardless of them being buds I actually do really enjoy them they don't leave your ears sore or make you uncomfortable while you're wearing them. They are completely noise cancelling so you will be yelling if you are wearing one and talking lol but It's something every ear bud does when it goes inside the ear."
"I received my TAGRY over the ear buds a couple days ago. They come in a handsome olive green well rounded case that displays the case's battery life. Although the case is larger than regular ear buds without the over the ear piece the case easily fit my jeans' pocket. The case is light weight and has a magnetic close with a satisfying ""click"" upon closing.

I listen to music, podcasts and play a game every now and again and these earbuds performed flawlessly. While listening to music I found the sound to be balanced without the overly done bass tones that you find sometimes in earbuds that cost 3 times as much! Voices while listening to podcasts are clear and rich. Yet, while playing games the sound still has that ""exaggerated gaming sound experience"" which seems to be necessary while playing games.

The fit and comfort is too notch. They're so light weight I barely realize they're in my ears! I've worn them several hours throughout the day and haven't had any ear pain. Which I sometimes get with more expensive ear buds. I wear either one or both and feel comfortable all day long!

Lastly, the earbuds are precisely what you need when you're not trying to spend a lot money or be fashionable."
"I ordered these Earbuds after my 2nd generation Airpods died. So far these have worked out great! For starters the order arrived 5 days after purchase. They arrived in a very nice, professionally wrapped package. They were charged up when I received them so I immediately put them on. They come with 3 different sizes of ear pads but the ones they had on them worked great with my ears. It paired very easily and quickly with my Google Pixel 8. I've been wearing them all day today and I have no pain or discomfort in my ears. My music sounds great on them and so do the phone calls. They are very simple to operate which is nice and the user manual is very easy to read and follow. I really like how simple it is to operate these earbuds and how comfortable they are in my ears. Lastly, they don't fall out! My airpods would fall off when I bent over or moved around a lot. These don't. The wrap around feature works great. If you are looking for a good set of ear buds, I would definitely consider these."
"Love these new ear buds from tagry. They are super comfortable with great sound. They fit my ears very well and very snug. I intentionally shook my head to see if they fall but they don’t move at all. They are fairly light and does not bother my ears at all. Had them in for about 2 hour work out and couldn’t tell they were in at all. Worked pretty well even with sweat.

I also liked the charger. Even though they give you a usb a to usb c charger, I have plenty of USB c chargers that make it very convenient to charge with chargers I already have around my house.

A few minor detractions but doesn’t take away from the five star rating. Case is a bit larger but because I understand since the earbuds are bigger. Also instead of touch, there are buttons on the ear buds you have to press instead of tapping. I actually like this as my head band has historically touched my other earbuds which would cause the music to stop.

All in all great ear buds and love the color as well!"
"I have small ears so I bought the white over the ear headphones and I love them! They don't go in my ears so they fit and I can still hear everything around me (including my toddler which is important).

My husband wanted to try these green ones that go in the ear and they fit him great! He said they block out most sounds around him which he likes when he's trying to focus and not hear the family doing our stuff.

However, the green ones do NOT fit small ears as you can see in my pictures. It comes with 3 sizes to try and even with the smallest I can't get it in my ear. So if you have small ears, go with the white ones!

Overall we love this brand as we haven't had any issues with the battery life or having them fall off/out of the ears.

My husband did say that the green ones don't rub on his ears the same way the white ones do. I have no issues at all with the white ones, so it really depends on the size of your ears.

Overall I would recommend either one for different reasons. They charge with USBC so we can also use our phone chargers if I forget to bring the one that comes with these when traveling."
"I like these for earbuds for many reasons. Foremost is the fact that ""typical"" insert earbuds don't really fit my ear canals properly. I don't know why but I've bought several higher priced versions and inevitably they fall out of my ears while I'm exercising. The ""earhooks"" help this from happening. I also like the tighter loop which also helps them stay attached to my ears without flopping around. I like mountain biking and these stay intact even when I'm bouncing around on the bike. The dark navy blue color is a nice touch as most of my earbuds are black. The sound quality is good. The bass is noticeable and the treble is sharp. I like that the charge notification is located on the outside of the case so I can see where the charge is at. I haven't precisely measured the 80 hours of run time, but it's double that of earbuds that I've bought in the past. I've exercised with these over ten times and haven't had to re-charge them yet. Overall, I think these earbuds are well worth the buy... especially at the price point! Enjoy the sound experience and I would definitely buy them again!"
Finally I discovered ear buds that fit my active lifestyle. I’m either outside running or working out at the gym daily. I can’t tell you how many times ear buds fall out of my ears during exercising. These not only fit perfectly and stay put but provide supreme sound quality and drown out all the people around me so I can focus on my workout. The packaging of the product told me it was a high quality item. I was able to easily connect them to various devices via Bluetooth without issue. Knowing the percent of charge is extremely helpful because often times I can’t remember when I charged my earbuds last and led screen makes it very easy to read at anytime. These earbuds are comfortable on my ears; they don’t pull or tug like some other brands. Overall I’m very satisfied with my purchase.
"I’ve been using the TAGRY Bluetooth earbuds for a bit, and they’re pretty solid overall. The packaging is decent, and the earbuds themselves have a nice build quality. The blue color is a nice touch, though not a major selling point for me.

As for the sound, they’re quite good—clear with a decent range on both the highs and lows. They’re not audiophile-level, but they’re more than enough for everyday listening and calls. The built-in mic does a decent job, and I haven’t had any issues with call clarity.

The battery life is definitely a strong point. I can go several days without needing to recharge, and the LED display is a convenient feature to keep an eye on the battery level. The earbuds fit securely with the ear hooks, which is great for workouts, and the waterproof design gives me some peace of mind when I’m out in the rain or sweating.

The Bluetooth connectivity works as expected—pairing is quick and stable, and I haven’t noticed any major lag or disconnection issues. The one-button control is straightforward and easy to use, which I appreciate.

Overall, these earbuds are a solid choice if you’re looking for something reliable with good sound and battery life. They’re quite good for the price, and they’re definitely worth considering for everyday use."
"First off I want to say that my I am very satisfied with this purchase! I've been using the X18 models lately and have been very happy with them, but they kept falling out of my ears when I'm working. These X88 models are the perfect fit to my problem because of the hook that goes around the ear! It don't sound like a big deal but I comfortably wore these ear buds throughout my shift for the first time today and I would definitely recommend to someone that wants a good quality, water resistant, comfortable, and stylish ear bud at a great price! I was going for the black model initially but was out of stock at the time. I'm glad I got these blue ones and I'll be using them everyday now! Btw the battery life is amazing as well."
"I’ve been using the Tagry Bluetooth earphones for a few weeks now, and I have to say, I’m impressed! These little earbuds have exceeded my expectations, and I’m so glad I decided to give them a try.

First off, the sound quality is amazing. I listen to all kinds of music, from pop to podcasts, and everything sounds great with these earphones. The bass is strong enough to make my music feel full and rich, but it’s not overpowering. The vocals and instruments come through clearly, which makes everything from upbeat tunes to chill tracks sound fantastic. Even when I’m in noisy places like the gym or on a busy street, I can still hear everything perfectly.

Comfort is a big deal for me, especially because I wear earbuds for hours at a time. The Tagry earphones come with different sizes of ear tips, so I was able to find the perfect fit for my ears. They’re comfortable, even when I’m wearing them for long stretches. I’ve taken them on runs and used them during workouts, and they stay put no matter what. Plus, they’re so light that I sometimes forget I’m even wearing them!

Connecting these earphones to my phone was super easy. They paired up right away, and the connection has been rock solid. I love that they automatically connect as soon as I take them out of the case—it’s such a time saver! I’ve wandered around my house with my phone in one room and me in another, and the connection stays strong, which is really convenient.

The battery life is another big win. I can go for hours on a single charge, which is perfect for long workdays or trips. The charging case is small enough to fit in my pocket, and it holds enough juice for several recharges. I never have to worry about them dying on me during the day. When they do need charging, it’s quick, so I’m never without my music for long.

The touch controls are easy to use and super responsive. I can control my music, take calls, and even use my phone’s voice assistant without having to take out my phone. The earphones are also water and sweat-resistant, which is great because I don’t have to worry about them getting damaged when I’m out in the rain or sweating during a workout.

Final Thoughts

All in all, I’m really happy with the Tagry Bluetooth earphones. They sound great, are comfortable to wear, and have many useful features that make them perfect for everyday use. These earphones are a fantastic choice whether you’re working out, commuting, or just chilling at home. If you’re looking for a solid pair of Bluetooth earphones that won’t break the bank, I highly recommend giving Tagry a try. You won’t be disappointed!"
"I’ve never had a pair of headphones/earbuds that will properly stay in. This pair may be the solution to my problem. They are comfortable and feel secure in my ear. The hook part that goes over the top and back of my ear doesn’t irritate my ear and was comfortable after many hours of wear. I’ve had them for four days and have used them about three times. I haven’t charged them and they are still at 80%. The case is larger than most but this helps me locate it quicker when it’s at the bottom of my purse. I’ve used them to take phone calls, to listen to music, and to stream videos. In each case, the volume was sufficient and I have no complaints."
"I was going to wait a few days before writing a review, but it only took a few hours of wearing these earbuds to know how comfortable they are and how great the sound quality is. I already have another pair of Tagry earbuds...the ones that are more similar in shape to the Apple earbuds, so I knew the sound quality was going to be good, but these are honestly the most comfortable pair of earbuds I've ever tried. I have smaller ear canals apparently, and the wrap around feature of this style really works well for me. I couldn't be happier with how they fit, feel and sound. I had a pair of Apple earbuds and they were hard and uncomfortable... not to mention expensive. They also stopped working after two years. This company also offers a lifetime warranty with product registration, so for the price you can't go wrong. Honestly...I think they are even a better quality of sound than the more expensive Apple earbuds, and again super comfortable. A great product for the money. You'll be super satisfied with these Tagry earbuds."
"I have earbuds from the same company and I like them a lot, but I needed something that would stay firmly in place when I'm working outside. These fit very nicely and the sound quality is excellent. The control buttons are easy to locate with your fingers and make volume control, track changes and pausing easy. I'm surprised by the volume - my hearing is weak and these can really crank up the sound without loss of fidelity. The instructions are easy to understand. I could easily use all the functions after only a few minutes to experimentation. I'm used to the tiny earbuds, so these will take some getting used to but the quality of sound and secure fit will make that process easier."
"These headphones fit better as the earpiece fits nicely into the ear. The sound quality of the headset is nice and clear when listening to music and also talking on the phone. The range for this product was over 30 feet as I was able to do yard work and chores while placing the phone at a fixed location. Also based on what my family has said, when on the phone they can hear my conversation with them very clearly. They fit nicely in my pocket and last longer than three hours. Long enough for the bus ride to work and home. The products from this company are getting better and better, I plan on getting these as gifts for the family"
"I bought these earbuds because I am a fan of Tagry's other earbuds that I have. Usually, I get the ones designed like airpods that do not have over-the-ear hooks, but my mom recommended trying ones like these. I found they are just as comfortable as the other earbuds, but I'm not as worried about losing them or them falling out, which reduces my stress (I am always almost losing my other earbuds lol). Its nice for when I am working out or cleaning around the house. The sound is also nice and clear. I have not used them for phone calls yet, but I am sure they will be as good as their other products. Finally, the case is larger than the non-hook earbuds, which is nice because I can find it more easily. I do wish the case came in a bright color so it would be easier to see in my backpack or purse, but that's a minor preference."
"The sound quality and volume on these earbuds are really good for this price point. They connect to my phone SO EASY and I don’t have to fight to sync them like other pairs I’ve had!! I also like the fit on my ears - not having to constantly adjust them or push them in like I have to on most earbuds. The case they come in is a little large for my taste, but it has to be due to the size of the earbuds. Touch controls are useful to adjust volume, pause, etc without having to use your phone. I ran into an issue and contacted the seller, they were responsive and resolved my issue quickly! Highly recommend."
"The case is looking great. The headset is in good condition and perfect for my ear. I love the sound quality of this product, and I used it for my morning run and the loop to the ear really works well. It is better than just an earbud. It blocks the outside noise really well that I had to use only one headset when I run sometimes so I can be aware of my surroundings at the same time. The battery life is great too. I can use it for hours of without recharging them. The case, which is the charging port, I can use them for a week without recharging them. Great product for a price. Would buy again for as a gift."
"I purchased these as an upgrade from a previous model of Tagry earbuds and am very pleased with my decision. Pairing easily to both my IPhone and Android tablet, I'm really impressed with the sound. I like how they feel in and on my ears. Using them frequently when doing stuff in the yard, the over the ear loop design is both comfortable and reassuring, as it lets me move around without the fear of them falling out. I can easily get a good 30 feet or so from my device and the sound is still crystal clear. Buttons respond well to light touch. I haven't actually kept a record of use so far, but can say that I've used them quite a bit on the first original charge. If the previous model is any indication, I am sure to be pleased with these for quite some time to come."
"I have experimented with several pairs of wireless earbuds over the years and was thankfully to finally find the excellent products offered by Tagry a few months ago. I had previously purchased the Tagry X08 earbuds and they are easily the best earbuds that I had purchased in my life. So, I decided to get another set of Tagry X88 earbuds to give them a try as well. Well, I'm here to tell you that the X88 earbuds didn't disappoint at all either! So, easy to charge with the case, connect to any of your devices and easily control phone calls, volume, music track play/pause and music track next/previous. I would highly suggest these earbuds to anyone rather than wasting your money on some of the other overpriced brands that I've had over the years and left disappointed from my experience. Go with Tagry, you won't be disappointed!"
I had previously bought the X08 Bluetooth headphones and absolutely loved them! I was very impressed with the battery life and the sound quality overall. I used to have a set of wired headphones that went over my ear that were perfect for working and exercising. I wanted to try an option for that with the wireless capability. I ordered these and have been trying them for a couple weeks now and the sound quality is GREAT! I’m very happy with how well they stay in/on my ears while working and exercising. I have used them while on a phone call as well and the sound quality there is good as well. I asked my wife how I sounded to her and she said there was no discernible difference than just using the phones mic. I am not the biggest fan of this shade of green but my wife likes it. I will most likely give these to her and order another one in black for myself.
"I loved these headphones; they have great sound quality with no static or weird back noise. The sound is clear and can be adjusted for your needs, be careful as the volume can go very high. I have the x15 earbuds by this same brand but they fall off during high intensity workouts this was a great alternative to that due to the band that goes around the ears. The buttons on the side make it easy and quick to pause, play, skip. The battery lasts about 3 hours and the case is good to recharge them about 4 times before it needs to be plugged in. I have an android so i just use the same cable to charge the case but it comes with its own charging cable as well as more in-ear pieces to adjust to your personal preference. Overall great buy, great quality, very well priced."
"These TAGRY Earbuds Wireless Bluetooth Headphones arrived quickly after I placed the order. The packaging was carefully done, and I felt excited even before opening the box. The contents inside are stylish and sophisticated.

The earbuds are very lightweight, and since they’re the type that hook over your ears, they stay securely in place even during running, so there’s no worry about accidentally losing them.

The sound quality is excellent, delivering clear audio that allows you to fully enjoy your music.

The navy blue color is calm and suitable for any situation. This is a product I’m genuinely satisfied with after a long time.

Charging is very easy, and the indicator displays the charging percentage, making it easy to know how much charge is left. Plus, these earbuds have excellent battery life, so there’s no need to worry about running out of power even with extended use. I can confidently use them for 2-3 days without recharging.

I also love the rounded shape of the case—it’s really cute and appealing."
"I have both X08 and this X88 sport ear-pods. I am a runner and cyclist who is always on the movements. The X08 has not so well fitting when conducting some serious running and I have to ensure each ear-pod is still hold tightly in my ear. You can feel the loose and smaller music volume when X08 is not wearing well. However, it fits perfectly when you don’t need to move your head. X88 is a game changer for the price and the performance! it fits perfectly well and much more precise for the volume control. X88 can be lower volume than the X08. I just like both products are in hand and I am able to choose which environment or activity meets the need. Highly recommend this X88 ear-pods. Give it a try and it light weight and long battery life for you to run long distance!"
"Received these ear buds very quickly in a very nice looking package. Opening the box up, you’ll find the earbuds in their case, a manual and a small box, containing a short USB-C charging cord and 3 sets of different sized “bud cushions”.
I pulled the ear buds out, which were at about 90% power and put them to use. Connecting to my phone was quick and seamless. The buds are very comfortable in my ears with the default “cushions” and I personally didn’t have to make any adjustments. I am very pleased with the sound quality as well. I am more than good with the volume at about 60% on my phone.
The case is a dark navy blue and although very light, seems to be very well constructed. One point I love is the fact that the power level is on the outside for quick glance viewing. I have another pair where it is on the inside and you cannot see it unless you open the case up.
Recommend these for great sound at a solid price point!"
"This is my third pair of Tagry headphones because I love them so much!. I have two pairs of the in ear buds that I am obsessed with but wanted a pair of buds I could run with that were a bit more secure to my ear and I’ve found them! I could say many great things about these but here are the top reasons why I love them: the olive color, the sleek look of the case and buds, they have great functional buttons with easy to remember controls, and wonderful sound clarity. There is just the right amount of bass, the battery lasts longer than any other headphones I’ve owned and they fit really well for myself and my husband when we switch out the ear tips.

I promise you will not regret purchasing any Tagry headphone but if you’re looking for something that looks nice, sounds wonderful, has a good microphone and stays stable in your ear look no further!"
"These Tagry wireless bluetooth earbuds have clear audio and they stay on the ear. I like the easy to use features and buttons- powering on and off, increasing/decreasing volume, skipping to next track, etc. I use them to go hiking and so far am happy with them. I'm even thinking of using them to be my primary earbuds to replace my current earbuds that I use for hiking and outdoor activities. I have not used them in water yet to test the waterproof feature, but am looking forward to doing that and am sure it will work. Good Job, Tagry"
"I bought these earbuds originally because of the claim of “10 hours of playtime per charge.” Well, they have lived up to that promise! Plus, they alround terrific sound, with solid Bass. Their control buttons are easy to use, with simple hookup both to my iPhone and my LG tv. One thing that really surprised me was their RANGE! I live in a solid brick house and take out my dogs down my 100’ driveway - and the earbuds keep their connection to my tv! In other words, an amazing value from Tagry, as usual."
"I was not optimistic about these new TAGRY X88 earbuds. They seemed too bulky, and I wasn't keen on the color. BUT I soon forgot all that, and I urge you to BANISH SIMILAR CONCERNS. After putting on the X88 earbuds, I appreciated how solid and stable they felt. I knew I wouldn't have to worry about them falling out or sliding out of place, something that seems to happen (SO annoying) with insubstantial earbuds—and I'm not even active! NOTE: They were comfy looped behind my ear even while wearing a headband plus eyeglasses. These X88 earbuds have now leapfrogged over two other sets and are now my preferred earbuds.

The sound quality is also solid and easy to adjust. Set up was so easy and straightforward that I could have easily managed it without reading the directions. But because I have a *thing* about clear directions, I read them. Well done, Tagry!"
"I just received this TAGRY Earbuds Wireless Bluetooth Headphones 80Hrs Playtime Ear Buds with Earhook IPX7 Wat and tested its quality which is excellent than another Tagry earbud I bought before.

The sound of Tagry earbuds is the best and especially this model is the top quality for listening to music
and easy to control volume which response is very quick and easy !

I needed this type to use while jogging, traveling, and hiking to prevent losing the earbuds!

The size is bigger than normal earbuds and looking is not so nice, but it is needed to have this kind of style especially when riding on a bus or train.

Thanks for the nice quality and convenience!"
"The new model ear buds, X88, from Tagry Club are wonderful at an unbelievable low price! Their fit around your ear won’t become dislodged. They are very easy to pair with your smart phone. The clarity of phone calls and listening to music is outstanding. Since durability is always a factor to the owners long term satisfaction, I’m sure these are going to last. These Tagry Club X88s come in variety of colors to fit anyone’s tastes. You are not going to find a better pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds, period!!!"
"I have been using the X08 set and really loved them. I thought I would try these because they have a loop that goes around my ears and secures them better. Success!! After I charged them I wore them for a little under 6 hours and absolutely loved them. They stayed exactly where I put them, the sound quality is excellent and people didn’t know I was talking on ear buds. My first time using them was doing yard work in a very noisy environment and they worked perfectly. I’m going to recommend them to a couple of my friends. Highly recommend them. Quality product at an excellent price."
These are my second pair of earbuds from this company-my first pair I bought a few years back and my son stole them from me because he liked them. I was nervous about the cost of air pods and losing them or having them fall out. I love the ease of these and I think they look great too!! Sound quality is great too and the fit is perfect and they send the extra plastic tips if not! Bluetooth connectivity was easy and the charging cord was appreciated as cords get lost/misplaced so often. The case is small enough to have in my purse so I have them available at all times! Great earbuds and a great price!!
"I have used other earbuds from this company and loved them, but these are incredible!! They are very comfortable on my ears, which is important because I use them for work and working out. And they have different size ear piece covers, which is nice! The sound quality is AMAZING!!!!! I have never had a pair of headphones or earbuds with this kind of quality. Very clear for phone calls too! These are very user friendly. Arrived fully charged, so I was able to pair with my phone in seconds. I would highly recommend these!! And the price is top notch!! The quality of these are as good, if not better, as the ones that cost 5 times more!!!"
"I needed some earbuds that would stay in my ear and these definitely do the trick. They are comfortable around my ear but stay locked in after sweating and exercise. They arrived in simple packaging and were easy to setup. I was listening to tunes and taking calls in minutes. The earbuds have a nice, rich sound and can suppress the surrounding noises. Easily put them back in the case to charge. I like the charge display that shows both the earbud charge and the case charge %. I still haven't had to charge the case after several hours of usage."
"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ The Best Headphones I've Ever Owned—Again!

These headphones from my favorite brand have once again exceeded my expectations! This is the third pair I've purchased, and I couldn't be happier. The sound quality is simply unbeatable, with crisp highs, deep bass, and perfect clarity across all genres of music.
I keep them on my bus, in my car and my backpack to ensure I always have a pair accessible.

The comfort level is outstanding—I can wear them for hours without any discomfort. The battery life is impressive, lasting me through days of heavy use on a single charge. Plus, the noise-cancellation feature is a game-changer, completely immersing me in my music or work, no matter where I am.

If you're on the fence about these headphones, don't be! I've been loyal to this brand for years, and they never disappoint. Highly recommend!"
"These earbuds have great sound and long listening time. They connect to my phone better than my $1500 Costco hearing aids and the sound is much better. My wife and I use our phones and earbuds when riding bicycles. It is safer to be able to communicate about cars, road hazards, and other safety issues. There is very little wind noise when riding. They stay securely in place when I tilt them to the rear of each ear. I have yet to run these earbuds out of power between charges. I cannot understand why someone would want to pay more for a set of earbuds. These are really good."
"I had a pair of these, and now I've got them as a gift because I've been very happy with my pair. I hate jogging, and these make the task much more enjoyable--I listen to podcasts and music and whatever else my phone has to offer without worrying about wires here and there or fear of batteries running out. Sound quality is great. They are also very easy to charge by simply putting them back in their case. In addition, they come with simple but effective instructions for people like me who do not really understand electronics and simply follow directions to make use of gadgets."
"This product is really good. The sound is really clear. The base is really good. I like the color. It is actually been one of the best earbuds I have ever bought. There was no hassle in getting them. I ordered them on Tuesday and they arrived on Wednesday. You don’t have to use both. One works without using the other one. The charge last three days, as they turn off when they do not sense being in the ear. They are a pretty, dark, greenish, teal color. LOL! One of my favorite colors. They don’t hurt my ears and they fit very comfortably. I can wear them without them falling out and they are so easy to put on and take off! These are winners for me, for sure! 👍🏼"
"I have enjoyed my Tagry earbuds for almost a year now, and was so impressed by the product that I had to grab up their new sport Ear buds as soon as I saw they were available! And they did not disappoint! Super comfy in my small ears. Great sound. Easy to connect. To get such an amazing product for such a low price compared to the big name brands that you pay too much for, in this economy, is just wonderful!"
"I'm a fan of tagry products already, and these new ear bud don't disappoint.
This new model has the soft over the ear hook which is great when exercising, holding the unit in place providing crystal clear sound. They are super comfortable and when using then with your phone you are heard clearly by the person you're talking to. I set my phone down and wander around while on calls so it has great range.
The case is wonderful and charges the buds while not wearing them and the charge last longer than any I've ever seen.
Do your self a favor and get these, you won't regret it. (At this price they are also great for gifts!)"
"I like how there not as bassy as the x08 and I don't here buzzing when I pause a video I like how there have earclasp and the connectivity is fast.the olive green color is cool but I hate the it got delivered with one bud not charge but the sound is excellent.

"I love these earbuds, they have amazing sound quality and are built so well. I totally recommend these over other popular brands. I was skeptical as first due to the low price but I ended up being surprised with the quality of them and how great my music now sounds and I do not have to worry about losing them due to the great price. Also has great battery that can last me days."
"While these are slightly larger than your typical inside-the-ear buds, I actually love it. The ear hooks are soft and comfortable. agronomics aside, let's discuss the most important thing when evaluating earbuds - the sound. These have an amazing range! I am really happy with the bass range, and when the high notes come, whether be a female vocalist, a piano, etc, the treble is crisp and clear.
Two thumbs up from me."
"""These headphones have been great for me. The call quality so far has been excellent and haven't had any complaints about my work calls. The sound quality has also been good enough and blocks out noise. I have nothing to complain about in this regard. I like how they fit in my ear while I sleep while listening to a long YouTube video. I like this brand finally has outer touch buttons that are not very sensitive to accidentally starting or stopping what I am listening to. I like the charging case as well and really have used this for a full work day haven't seen the battery drop to zero. The blue color of the headphones look nice to me and. The overall performance I am more than satisfied with."
"These earbuds are great ,The sound quality is rich, full and they can get pretty loud. When you need to make calls words come through crystal clear. Had a pair of the O'Keefe K23 earbuds a good while back and had been waiting for there latest earbuds to be put out . I saw they were endorsing tagry and figured they must be good for them to partner with them. I have had these for five days and still have not charged them yet . These earbuds will not disappoint .Thanks to the O'Keefe and Tagry company."
"These earbuds are fantastic! I didn’t even know I needed the support of the mechanism that goes around the ear, but these feel so secure. I appreciate the easy to locate button used to silence my music when approached by a conversationalist. The sound quality is great as well. I have no complaints and am pleased with this purchase. This is my second pair of earbuds by this brand and I have been satisfied with both pairs."
"This will be my 3rd pair of Tagry BT earbuds, they never disappoint. I'd have to say, these are my favorite of my purchases. The ear loops give a more secure fit, ear buds always tend to fall out of my ears. The sound quality is fantastic, and the clarity seems to be great as well while using them for phone calls. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend these."
I purchased these earbuds for my husband who has trouble keeping other earbuds in his ears. We have several other pair of TAGRY headphones and the quality is great. My husband prefers these over his other wireless earbuds. His only complaint is they are a little difficult to wear with sunglasses. Great sound quality. Charge holds for quite awhile. Easy to pair with our iPhone. Highly recommend this brand!
I think I’ve found a new pair of earbuds for my runs! These are lightweight and I don’t worry about them falling out of my ears (like has happened with ones in the past). They are also more comfortable than the insertable earbuds because they don’t seem to go as far in the ear and aren’t being held in as much by the compression between the ear bud and the ear canal. Very cool!
I always buy this brands headphones. They are affordable. Comfortable. Sound quality is fantastic. Lots of different options as well to suit your needs. Ive never had a problem with them. I do insurance sales and these are the perfect headphones to buy for any kind of business call. I love the ease of use for the price. Charge lasts great and they do come charged and ready to go as well.
"I’ve previously purchased 4 pairs of Tagry earbuds (not this model) and have been very impressed with the quality of sound and how long they hold a charge. I needed an ear bud for when I am at the gym or doing other physical activities that won’t fall out and these definitely fit the bill. They are lite in the ear, the sound quality is great, they hold a charge just for a long time and most importantly they don’t fall out of my ears after working up a sweat. I highly recommend these ear buds."
"I’m loved the older X08 version, especially for work because they fit comfortably under my ear protection. The X88’s are a clear step above in sound and, look, and function. I like the button on them that is more reliable than the “touch control” of other Bluetooth earbuds. If you want something affordable with built in quality I would recommend these to anybody and will gift them to family soon."
"First off, the sound is amazing. The bass and treble blend so well even at a lower volume. The fit is great. This has been my struggle with other earbuds. I have used them while running and strength training and they do not budge. My husband has also tried them and they fit perfectly! I’ve wasted so much money on earbuds that don’t fit so I’m glad to have finally found the perfect pair!"
"Case quickly charged on arrival. Pairing was easy and straightforward. Sound quality is excellent for music, videos or calls. My daughter said I was much clearer on these than on speaker phone. Nice touch that they send you extra earbuds in different sizes so you can customize the fit. Earpiece is soft and very flexible so it is very comfortable. The charging cord is quite short and does not come with a plug, but I have several plugs already. Any C type cord will work to charge. As noted it holds a charge quite a long time. Overall? Very satisfied with the new ear buds."
"I was only able to try these earbuds out for a short time before my daughter stole them for herself. We love Tagry earbuds, and have several sets in our household, and these are no exception.
I really like the color of these as well as the comfort and secure fit. I think the sound quality may be even better than with my X08s, which I love. They pair really easily and don't lose the connection. The durability is also very impressive. I lost an earbud in a parking lot, where it rained, found it a week later, and it still works wonderfully even now, a year later. I don't think I've had other earbuds as high of a quality."
"I can't use earbuds .. it always falls off.. so I like over the ear type designs .. I have many many many headphones .. more than. I would like to admit!!! I have been looking for one that fits the bill and sounds good and more importantly, the mic is good ... So I can talk to people on the phone while listening to music with minimal effort (while driving etc).

This one is it!!! It checks all the boxes. I would rather have a nicer color than green but it's ok. Would highly recommend to anyone I like. 😜"
The previous design for these had a flaw. It felt like flimsy plastic and the over ear hook broke off too easily. We will see how these do. These I feel have a way better design and the bass to mid and high level frequencies are perfect. The case is still big but charging is simple. I love the smoothness of the connection and the fit is snug. Visually i appreciate the matte navy blue finish. Paring is also simple waterproof makes it ideal for working out or listening in he shower( don't fully spay water on them or submerge them) Powering off is easy and the 80 hr is a godsend. For the price go with this company and these theheadphones
"I had another pair without the ear hook and I always felt like they would fall out, these are very secure. Also, there is a button on each that actually pushes in and out. My last pair were touch sensitive, so I was always turning up the volume by accident and blasting my eardrums out! That's not an issue with these. They are very basey, I love them!"
"These are so comfortable to wear around my ears. Feels like I don’t have anything on and fit like a charm. I wear them when at the gym, around the house, and doing yard work. The quality of the sound is awesome. Haven’t had any difficulty hearing or out of range from my phone. I love the olive green color!"
I have purchased many of these earbuds by Tagry. It is all upgrade of course. These are hand downs my favorite so far. Bluetooth connection is amazing. Sound quality is excellent. The ease of using the earbuds is great. Battery life is amazing and loving it. The comfort of wearing these earbuds is unbelievable. They never fall off and don’t hurt your ears. I am happy with the blue color. I give this company and the earbuds a 100pct rating. I highly recommend everyone to purchase them.
"I've owned tagry earbuds in the past --and have been happy with the quality and performance of all of them. I still use the K08 model at my desk for video calls and music. These new ones (model X88) are even better. I particularly like ""in the ear"" with the silicon covers. They come with 3 different sizes -- my ears are a bit small, so I swapped the covers for a better fit. I've been the pool in the mornings --and I have to admit I was a bit skeptical -- but they worked well. I wanted to be able to listen to music and CNBC while I swim -- and I was stunned. Worked great."
"When I first started using the TAGRY X88 Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds, I was immediately impressed by the audio quality. The 13mm drivers deliver such clear and crisp sound, with rich bass and detailed highs that really elevate my listening experience. Whether I’m on a call or just enjoying some music, the built-in microphone ensures that my voice comes through clearly, which is great for staying connected on the go.

The battery life is another feature that has truly won me over. With 10 hours of playtime on a single charge and up to 80 hours with the charging case, I never have to worry about them dying on me during long trips or busy days. The LED power display on the case is super handy, giving me a quick glance at how much juice is left.

One of the things I love most is how well these earbuds fit. The ear hooks are sturdy and keep the earbuds in place even during intense workouts, and the different sizes of eartips included in the box made it easy to find the perfect fit for my ears. Plus, with the IPX7 waterproof rating, I don’t have to stress about sweat or rain—these earbuds can handle it all.

Connecting them via Bluetooth is a breeze, thanks to the latest 5.3 technology. The connection is always stable and quick, so I can get right to my music without any annoying delays or dropouts. The one-button control is also really intuitive, letting me manage my music, calls, and volume with ease.

The design is sleek and the navy color is a nice touch. They’re lightweight, comfortable to wear for hours, and the portable charging case is perfect for keeping them safe and charged while I’m on the move.

Overall, the TAGRY X88 has been a fantastic addition to my daily routine. Whether I’m working out, traveling, or just enjoying some downtime, these earbuds deliver on every front. I’m really happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable, high-quality pair of wireless earbuds."
"These new X88 Tagry earbuds are great for workouts! The ear loop keeps them in place while working out much better than my X08. The audio quality is great and reliable as the X08 as well. I really like the Olive color on it. The case shows the percentage of the battery left, plus the animation as the earbuds are charging. One thing I miss is the wireless charging that the X08 have, but it's not a deal breaker. And while the case is larger than the X08 due to the bigger size of the earbuds, it still fits very comfortable in my pocket.
Overall I'm very pleased with this purchase and look forward to many good years of service out of these X88 earbuds! I would highly recommend them!"
"I just received these today and tried them out. They connected quickly and easily to my iPhone 12. They are comfortable, though I had to switch to the smaller silicone pieces since I have small ears (they come with three sizes). They also sound great! I was really impressed with the sound quality. I like the dark blue color and the fact I can see the battery percentage on the case. These will be my go to ear buds when I’m running or doing yard work."
"I was looking for a good pair of Bluetooth earbuds that gave me exceptional comfort, crystal-clear sound quality, and great range....with these Tagry earbuds, I found them!

Very comfortable, great sound, and I'm yet to lose the connection when i leave my phone in the office and walk around my 3000 sq ft house, with my old pair this was always a problem.

These earbuds have really transformed my daily routine, from working out, making calls, to listening to music without any interruptions. Very happy with my purchase!"
"These earbuds truly lives up to its promises. The sound is crystal clear with a balanced mix of bass and treble. The battery life really lives up to the claim, they fit comfortably and don’t shift or fall out. Pairing is quick and hassle-free, and I haven’t experienced any connectivity issues. The microphone quality is impressive. Calls are clear, and the person on the other end can hear me without any issues.
Overall, these are high-quality earbuds for an active lifestyle and I Highly recommend them!"
"The earbuds were incredibly easy to pair with my device, and the connection has been reliable so far. The fit is comfortable and secure, making them great for long listening sessions or workouts. I've used these earbuds during outdoor runs, and they stayed in place without any issues. The call control and volume management buttons are conveniently located and easy to use, allowing me to adjust settings without any hassle. Overall, these earbuds are a great value for the price, and I would definitely recommend them to anyone in the market for reliable and affordable wireless earbuds."
I love them! I was looking for a pair of earbuds to jog with. These one are perfect. They stay in place and I can hear my music with nearly with few exterior noises. The batteries last a long time. I am happy with the olive color which I find very special. Definitely a great purchase.
"I recently picked up the Tagry X88 USB-C corded earbuds, and I’ve got to say, they’re probably some of the best earbuds I’ve owned. First off, the design is fantastic. These aren’t your typical wireless earbuds that just sit in your ear. The wrap-around-ear style gives them a super secure fit, which is great because I never have to worry about them falling out, whether I’m running errands or hitting the gym. Plus, they’re really comfortable. I’ve worn them for hours on end, and they don’t cause any discomfort at all, which is rare for me with earbuds.

Now, let’s talk sound quality. These things are loud! If you’re like me and love turning up your music, you won’t be disappointed. The bass is deep, and the overall sound is crisp, whether I’m listening to music, podcasts, or even making phone calls. It’s hard to find earbuds that hit that sweet spot between clarity and volume, but the Tagry X88 nails it.

Another thing I love is the noise-canceling effect. They don’t have active noise cancellation, but the fit is so snug that it blocks out a ton of background noise. I’ve used them at work, and they really help me tune out everything around me. The deep blue color is a nice touch too. It’s subtle but stylish, and I’ve gotten a few compliments on how cool they look.

All in all, I’m really happy with these earbuds. They’re comfortable, sound amazing, and stay put no matter what I’m doing. If you’re in the market for a reliable, great-sounding pair of earbuds, the Tagry X88 is definitely worth checking out."
Battery life lasts a good amount of time before needing to be charged. Absolutely love these ear pieces so far. The pieces fit great around my ears and are extremely comfortable. Getting the extra ear pieces is helpful. They charge very quickly and easily. Great volume and quality is very good. Would highly recommend to others.
"Theses Tagry X88 earbuds are an excellent choice at this price point. The over ear configuration provides added comfort and stability for sport or other high level activities. Notably, the ease of use and most importantly sound quality and high fidelity make these an excellent choice. These ear buds are on par with much more expensive alternatives. Super happy with my purchase."
"I had another set of Tagry earbuds before and unfortunately lost them at the gym. These are my second pair and they are even better! The fit is great with the the loops behind my ears and the sound is clear and crisp. I like that the color is different from the usual white or black. I had no problem syncing them to my phone and they even tell you the battery percentage on the outside of the case.
Tagry did a fabulous job improving their product! Highly recommend!!"
"After Using these headphone for 2 weeks, I can honestly say these are well worth the price as they deliver excellent quality, clarity, and battery life. I haven't put these on the charger after the initial charge and have used them dozens of times. I am very happy with my purchase"
"I have a couple pairs similar to these that I misplace from time to time so I got an extra pair to keep in my home office. These have the best call quality so far! I used them all day today with a window AC unit blowing in the background and sound was crystal clear. Price point is great for the quality. I highly recommend. Oh, and the color is lovely. Deep olive green tones are my faves!"
"I have always had Tagry ear buds. This is my third one. The new one, (the one on the left) are much smaller than the previous versions. And surprisingly comfortable too. The sound quality is amazing! The initial pairing process has been simplified that you don't have to pair each ear bud at a time. Love the green color. Normally I wouldn't have picked this color, but I kinda like it. Go get yourself one. Thank me later!"
"I like these, ive had a few Tagry and they were bigger than these. I like these these they are a bit more compact. Sound quality is good and battery life is great I don't have to charge them every day and that's good. They are also comfortable for all day wear, (I use them at work) I'm overall happy with the purchase and will likely continue with the brand in future (I leave them places in my travels so I buy a lot of eat buds)"
"To be honest, for the cost, the sound is really good. The fit is very nice and comfortable. The settup was simple and I will be using them at the gym as the sound is good, is loud, and the over the ear hook will help keep them in my ears too."

I've been using the Tagry X88 earphones for a while, and overall, I'm impressed with what they offer at their price point.

**Sound Quality:**
The sound quality is solid. At mid-high volume, the bass is punchy without being overwhelming, and the mids and highs come through clearly. At pow volume, you wont hear much of the instrumentals. They're not audiophile-grade, but for casual listening—whether it’s music, podcasts, or videos—they perform well.

**Comfort and Fit:**
These earphones are pretty comfortable for extended wear. They come with multiple ear tip sizes, so finding the right fit was easy. Once I had the correct size, they stayed snugly in my ears during workouts and didn’t cause any discomfort after long listening sessions. I also appreciate that they’re lightweight, which adds to the comfort factor.

**Battery Life:**
One of the standout features of the Tagry X88 is the battery life. I can go several days without needing to charge them, even with regular use. The charging case is compact and provides several additional charges, which is great for when I’m on the go. I’ve found that the advertised battery life holds up pretty well in real-world use. Take note, the case is going to be quite heavy.

**Connectivity and Controls:**
Pairing them with my devices was straightforward, and I haven’t experienced any major connectivity issues. The Bluetooth range is decent—I can leave my phone in one room and move around without losing connection. The touch controls are responsive, although there was a bit of a learning curve at first. After getting used to them, I found it convenient to manage playback and take calls without needing to reach for my phone.

**Build Quality:**
It is well built. The earphones and case feel sturdy and will hold for everyday use. The design is also sleek.

**Overall Impression:**
For the price, the Tagry X88 earphones offer a good mix of sound quality, comfort, and battery life. They’re not without their flaws, but they’re a great option for someone looking for budget-friendly wireless earphones that don’t skimp on the essentials. I’m happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable pair of everyday earphones."
I have purchased several earbuds and these were by far the easiest to set up and use out of the box. They came with a charging cord and we're fully charged out of the box. They connected without any trouble and the sound quality was exceptional especially considering the price point. I worked out with them and sweat didn't change the sound quality or cause any skipping issues. I have replaced my beats with these.
I like how it doesn’t fall out as I move around to do my work. I can bend easily. Also the sound is nice and clear and NATURAL. I kept looking if it’s actually coming from my ears. I like the color too. I get a different color for each family member.
"These are as good if not better than the ones that are all white and cost a ton, these also wont get lost as easy do to the fact that they wrap around your ear. Sound quality is great. I look forward to my yard work now, thats when I use them."
The earbuds came boxed nicely for gift giving and were fully charged. There is a digital display showing battery percentage. You pair them straight from the case and my iPhone immediately discovered and paired. I like that there are volume control buttons on the earbuds. They are very comfortable as I cannot wear regular in-ear buds and these are soft around the ear and the position of the bud is perfect. I definitely recommend.
"just received my Tagry X88 wireless earbuds, these are packaged well and attractive in appearance, They connected to my Iphone instantly with no issues, the sound and ease of use are great. these are super comfortable and the loop over the ear hold them super secure/locked in for running and other impact sports."
The connectivity to my devices ( tried with two different cell phones) was a breeze. The volume and clarity of the sound was one of the best I have heard. The earbuds were comfortable and easily fit in my ears. I would definitely recommend this earbuds.
"These are undoubtedly, greatest sound around and I do mean Sound. The ear pieces add so much security against loss. I have bought several pair and have been given, however these are Unbelievable. The sound alone, not to mention the price, very reasonably priced. You will not be disappointed."
"When I lost my airpods I bought these as a replacement until the new airpods with usb c were a thing. For the several months I used them, they were great for the sound quality/money and I'm leaving these at work whenever I forget to bring my airpods now.

Obviously its not airpod quaity and you get what you pay for but I think in an emergency these serve well enough and the noise cancellation/transparency mode is fair"
"El diseño muy simple, perfecto y liviano."
"A mí pareja le encantaron, excelente producto, puede usarse discretamente en la calle, sin problema"
Cool
Exelente
"En calidad, transparencia y cancelación es muy bueno, pero no tiene un volumen de sonido potente."
Muy buenos cumplen con lo que promete una utonomia muy buena
Nada que quejarse de estos audífonos
"I paid about $70 for these earbuds and was expecting them to be awesome and to last for a really long time. The noise cancelation featured worked great for maybe the first few weeks but then after that has started to get gradually worse and worse (I've had them for several months now). For me, this is not a huge deal because I don't really need noise cancellation, I can still enjoy music and podcasts without it. But still a disappointment.

The much bigger issue (for me personally) is the fact that the voice call microphone on them stopped working only after just a few months of use, despite always taking good care of the product (regular charging, cleaning buds and case, etc.) Now whenever I do phone calls, I can hear the other line but the other person can never hear me. At first I thought it was a connectivity issue with my phone and then looked into the earbuds. After several weeks of this ongoing issue, and doing a lot of research online and trying to troubleshoot and find a fix (to no avail), I've realized that unfortunately the microphone has just simply failed.

In conclusion, they earbuds are definitely not worth $70."
No existe manera alguna de conectar el LDAC. Solo conecta con el Primitivo SBC y con AAC
Like the sound
Perfect!
Son super buenos me encantaron los súper recomiendo
Esto lo compré para mi hijo de 14 años el es muy tecnológico y me explicó todo lo que tenía y waoo realmente elimina el ruido del exterior. Es un buen artículo calidad precio.
"Es mi segundo producto Xiaomi que compro. Estos auriculares de Xiaomi me sorprendieron sus características tecnológicas. Además de la facilidad para integrarlos a mi iphone, Sumado al excelente producto, sin la menor duda es una gran opción para los que les agrada escuchar música a través de un excelente producto."
"Loud, support transparency, noice canceling. Used with M8 software (look on playstore, or Apple store)"
"I bought these specifically for ANC. I have annoying neighbors around me and I work from home so I wanted noice cancelling headphones to block out the annoying sounds so I could focus on work. They exceeded my expectations in that area. I've bought several different kinds of ANC headphones in the same price range and the noise canceling on these is by far the best I've experienced so far.

AUDIO quality: 3/5
NOISE cancelling: 5/5
COMFORT: 3/5

Some issues I have with these are they frequently lose connection for a second while they reconnect when near devices on 2.4ghz wifi. Also, when you've got more than one device connected (example my PC and cellphone) it will disconnect me watching YouTube on my phone when I get an email on my PC, then it will switch back to my pbone and automatically play spotify instead of the youtube video I was watching.. super annoying."
"me gusto en general todo,y lo que no me gsuto es su configuracion"
"First off…if you are expecting Airpods Pro quality of audio then you shouldn’t be browsing for earbuds less than 200$.

But if you are looking to just spend about $120/150 (depending if you wait for a sale) on some great earbuds i think this is it!

They are built in a really great material, connection is really nice and fast just as airpods and if you loose one of them is not gonna be around $350!

They have everything for the day to day use of regular earbuds!"
"La verdad es que los audífonos son geniales, pero al inicio se cortaba mucho la música o los vídeos que estuviera escuchando, le instalé la aplicación y actualicé el software y se compuso, aveces ocurre cuando conecto varios dispositivos,espero ya no vuelva a ocurrir porque si es muy molesto"
All good
"Con el uso se empiezan a caer de la oreja, al quitarlos se sigue reproduciendo música o al escucharse una notificación se reproduce sola a música"
"Facile a coupler
Format ideal
Son excellent"
"Los audífonos son increíbles, más de lo que esperaba, solo q el problema lo tuve después de 2 semanas y la tapita de la caja se aflojó y está como suelta, pero fuera de eso el funcionamiento de los audífonos no le afectan."
"Many people aren't happy with the ANC, but I think its very good for earbuds. They might be confused due to the wind reduction mode. When wind speed reaches a certain threshold the ANC dissipates quite a bit in an attempt to reduce wind noise. At this stage the ANC is very slight.

When used in an environment without wind, it is very good. The earbud's nozzle is ovular, and they fit quite securely.

I had to return mine because their shape in the case requires your fingers to grip a smooth surface rather than to pop them out using geometry. When you live in Canada and your hands are cold 75% of the year, they're impossible to take out of the case as your fingers are too cold to deform to grip them."
Excelentes llegaron rapidos
"The product felt like good quality until i started having problems with the right bud's battery. 6 months after the purchase it started to not charge completely, it would last for only 30 minutes, then one day it stopped charging completely and now i have a dead right earbud"
"So, I bought these mainly for the noise cancelling. I tried to find a middle ground between cheap ones and high priced ones, and this was it. I also bought it for it being black for subtlety and also I would be too upset if I lost them at work. It has adaptive noise cancelling and I believe they’re also Hybrid Noise Cancelling, which is the best of the noise cancelling types.

I’ve been using these at work, around fans and several pressure water sprayers going off at the same time, and these things can cancel out 80-90% of the mids and lows, but only about 50% of the highs. It’s better than nothing. Sound is ok. Bass is ok. Mids and highs could be better. At one point, they seemed to be glitching out, and was cancelling noise cancelling and re-enabling it every few minutes. It stopped doing that after a couple of days. I wonder what was going on with that.

Battery life is good. I can get 6 hours of straight use out of it, with noise cancelling on. Charging is fast once it’s back in the case.

The only thing that doesn’t seem to work well is dictation. When I try to talk to type, my phone can never fully understand what I’m saying.

Other than that, decent headphones with adaptive hybrid noise cancelling for a decent price."
Me encantaron.
La calidad de audio es buena pero muy baja.
"Fue una buena compra, los materiales son de muy buena calidad y suenan muy bien!!!"
These worked great.
"Le cuffie, oltre ad essere di ottima fattura funzionano benissimo, si accoppiano subito con qualunque dispositivo, ottima qualità audio e durata della batteria, stanno molto comode all'interno dell'orecchio, rapporto qualità/prezzo davvero ottimo.
Super consigliate"
Rapport qualité prix imbattable.
"Werkt goed , mooi geluid"
Perfekt
"No son los mejores cascos, ni los que mejor suenan ni los que tienen mejor batería, pero calidad precio si son los mejores en todos los aspectos, calidad de sonido, batería y materiales.

Se conectan al dispositivo en cuanto abres la caja para sacar los auriculares, el sonido es nítido, no está saturado de graves que esto lo suelen hacer para tapar la (mala) calidad en auriculares de este segmento de precio.
La batería dura unas 5 horas y se recarga rápidamente.
Puedes usar solo uno si lo necesitas para trabajar y atender el móvil, se escucha muy bien la llamada y el micro es perfecto.
Se me perdió uno y lo entonces rápidamente por el sistema que tiene para encontrar el auricular perdido, esto me encantó.
Puntos negativos. En este segmento de precio sería absurdo poner un punto negativo porque calidad precio no se puede pedir más.
Si quieres un sonido con gravee, o un sonido completamente nítido, cancelación de ruido, o una batería que dure mucho,.tienes que gastar más dinero"
"po ok pol roku korzystania zaczely sie psuc, nie polecam"
"Me gusto mucho el sonido es calido (grave) pero muy bien en general y aunque no tienen muy alto volumen suenan muy bien, tengo de otras marcas y por el precio estan muy bien"
My son is very pleased with these earphones. He has recommended then to friends.
"O fone em si é mto bom.
Porem, o encaixe dele no ouvido é ruim.
Ele fica meio frouxo e solto, da medo de cair e quebrar.
Mas o resto é bem bom!"
"Kulak boşluğu küçük olanlara hitap etmeyebilir bana uymadı, yine de kulakta çok sağlam duruyor ve düşmüyor standart büyüklükte, airpods ile neredeyse aynı boyutlarda. Ürün ses ve kalite olarak fiyatına göre gayet başarılı. Araya 2 duvar girmesine rağmen ses kopmadı. Bluetooth bağlanır bağlanmaz kılıf ve kulaklıkların şarj yüzdeliği görünüyor ekranda. Eksi olarak silikonlu kulaklıklar kadar bass iyi değil tabi ki ama silikonsuz kulaklığa göre fena değil. Yurtdışından 15 gün içinde teslim edilecek yazmasına rağmen 7 günde teslim edildi."
"Preis/Leistung finde ich hier Top, hier war ich doch von dem guten Klang überrascht.
Vorweg, für den Preis muss man natürlich auch ein paar Abstriche machen.
Klang find ich gut, hatte zuvor AirPods 2, welche nach ein wenig über 2 Jahren bei fast täglichem Tragen den Geist aufgegeben haben, auf der Suche nach einer Alternative bin ich zuvor auf Marshall Minor III gestoßen, welche mich vom Klang her nicht überzeugt hatten, bei den AirPods 3 hatte ich immer wieder Verbindungsprobleme und auch beim Wechseln zwischen den unterschiedlichen Geräten, was mir der Preis dann doch nicht wert war. Nach längerem Suchen bin ich auf die Redmi Buds 4 lite gestoßen, das Aussehen fand ich schon ansprechend (ähnlich Airpods 3) und vor allem es gibt diese in der Farbe schwarz =).
Vom Klang her finde ich persönlich keinen wirklichen Unterschied zu den AirPods 2.

Es ist nur möglich ein Gerät zu Verbinden.
Es gibt eine LED an der Front.
Ansonst, schnell verbunden (auch unter iOS & Windows ohne Probleme)
Akkuanzeige ist am jeweiligen Gerät ersichtlich.
Das Gehäuse ist sehr leicht.
Zur Touch-Steuerung kann ich derzeit noch nicht viel sagen, da ich diese kaum verwende.

Update nach ca. einer Woche:
-) Pausieren bei Abnahme des Kopfhörers ist nicht vorhanden
-) Verwendung von nur einem Kopfhörer ist möglich
-) unter iOS habe ich ab und an kurze Aussetzer (nur wenn ich zwischen Apps hin und her wechsle)
-) Case ist sehr leicht, perfekt für unterwegs
-) Wer Umgebungsgeräusche unterdrücken möchte -> benötigt Kopfhörer mit ""Gummi""

Update nach 11 Monaten:
-) Funktionieren noch immer =)
-) unter iOS sind die Aussetzer nicht mehr vorgekommen

Update nach 14 Monaten:
-) rechter Kopfhörer funktioniert nicht mehr richtig (ist leiser als der linke)
Die Kopfhörer wurde zum Schluss auch zum Sport verwendent sowie am Strand,
wurden jetzt nochmals bestellt, da hier Preis/Leistung Top ist!"
"Un peu léger, il faudra être délicat avec le boitier"
Costaron poco y funcionan muy bien. Ya es el segundo par que compro. Unos para mi y otros para mi hijo. Evidentemente hay mejores auriculares en el mercado pero tiendo a perderlos y no quería gastar mucho. Gran durabilidad de la batería y buen sonido.
"Por el precio cumplen, a veces la conexión es inestable."
"Peut être pas les plus solides ou la meilleure qualité de son, mais hyper simples à utiliser avec un téléphone Xiaomi et bonne autonomie."
Bra i vardagen men kanske inget attt hurra för om man verkligen vill njuta av musik
"Connessione stabile e batteria duratura sono i due pregi principali di queste cuffie.
Costano poco, ma hanno comunque un marchio solido alle spalle, fanno il loro dovere anche meglio delle concorrenti sulla stessa fascia di prezzo. Se cercate ovviamente qualità elevate non sono la scelta giusta, ma se vi servono un paio di cuffie per tutti i giorni senza pretese sono imbattibili.

prezzo di acquisto 16.59€

PRO: leggere, comode, connessione stabile, batteria duratura, economiche, se le perdi non rischi la rovina economica, qualità audio molto accettabile per la loro fascia di prezzo.

CONTRO: non sono adatte per fare movimento o sport in generale, non isolano dai rumori esterni, chiamate poco nitide (ma comunque valide) per via dei microfoni di scarsa qualità."
"Ich kann nur sagen, dass es alle Erwartungen übertroffen hat, und das ist es, wonach ich lange gesucht habe, Es stört das Ohr nicht. Ich kann es nur wärmstens empfehlen, wenn man Sport treibt, im Auto telefoniert oder Musik hört."
"Pretty decent for the price, there does seem to be a problem with distance, sometimes putting my phone in pocket causes the audio to crackle a lot."
"Batterie tient longtemps, portée à 10 m. Parfait et noir, reste discret !"
"muy buen producto, no se pierde la señal al hacer ejercicio"
"Los Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 son una opción asequible y de alta calidad en el mercado de auriculares inalámbricos. Con un diseño compacto y ergonómico, ofrecen comodidad durante horas de uso. La calidad de sonido es impresionante para su precio, con graves potentes y agudos claros. Además, su conectividad Bluetooth garantiza una experiencia sin problemas al emparejar con dispositivos móviles. Con una duración de batería sólida y controles táctiles intuitivos, los Redmi Buds 4 son una excelente opción para aquellos que buscan auriculares inalámbricos confiables sin romper su presupuesto."
Fantastico e davvero piccolo l'alloggio di ricarica non è assolutamente ingombrante .... Gli Auricolari si collegano in un istante appena usciti dal suo cofanetto... Si sentono davvero bene e li porti tranquillamente a lavoro per intere giornate grazie al cofanetto di ricarica ...... Tutto ad un costo davvero competitivo....
It plays sounds great. Its quality is great in relation to its price.
"Visst, de kanske inte kan mäta sig med dyrare varianter, finns t.ex. ingen app för inställningar. Men duger utmärkt för att prata i telefon, lyssna på musik och podd. Skulle köpa igen om de tappas bort. 👍"
"Buen sonido , fue muy rápida la entrega"
"Top Klang, kann ich empfehlen und Top Preis"
"Bon produit, répond aux attentes et très intuitif."
"Tenía los Redmi Buds 3 Pro, y estos Redmi Buds 4 Lite se escuchan mucho mejor, con diferencia. Su diseño y los materiales son geniales. Por el precio que tienen cuesta creer que tengan un sonido así. Los graves son muy potentes, pomposos y no distorsionan, y los medios y agudos se escuchan nítidos. Muy buena imágen stereo y espacio 3D.
No tienen cancelación de ruido ni se echa en falta.

Detalles en contra: que no son compatibles con las apps de Xiaomi ni con la M8 no oficial, así que no tendrás un widget para ver la carga ni opciones o configuración de ningún tipo. Android muestra la batería que le queda a ambos auriculares pero no podrás saber la carga que tiene la cajita para guardarlos... en cierto modo, son casi tan simples como unos auriculares analógicos con cable. Y hablando de la cajita, ahí si que se nota que usaron materiales económicos, la tapa tiene rayaduras en solo un dia de llevarla en el bolsillo, y da la sensación de fragilidad, como si se fuese a romper.

¿Los volvería a comprar? Sin lugar a dudas.
¿Recomiendo su compra? A todo el mundo, sibaritas del sonido quedarán satisfechos. Yo vengo de usar toda la vida AKG, Sennheiser y Beyer Audio en estudios de música, creo que se lo que me digo..."
"Works great, good sound.
For the price excellent."
"Premesso che non sono un audiofilo per quanto riguarda le cuffie in ear, ho comunque piacere di poter sentire bene musica e parlato e di fare in modo che dall'altra parte mi sentano senza problemi.
Ho provato AirPods, Sony, Bose, Huawei, Xiaomi, Samsung, un po' di tutto insomma.
Questa volta volevo proprio spendere poco (pagate 16 euro).
Sono grossine, ma alle mie orecchie si adattano senza problemi, quindi da questo punto di vista, punto a loro favore.
Il volume non è altissimo, ma tenendolo al massimo capiamo senza problemi l'interlocutore e possiamo ascoltare musica anche in ambianti un po' rumorosi. Se siamo in ambienti silenziosi, dobbiamo perfino abbassare il volume.
La qualita è il loro maggiore punto interrogativo.
Non hanno un suono brutto, ma nemmeno troppo cristallino.
Se avete acquistato altri auricolari in questa fascia, questi saranno certamente migliori.
Se avete usato Samsung, Apple, o altre marche più blasonate, vi accorgerete della differenza.
Lo stesso vale per l'interlocutore che ci sente bene, ma non come se stessimo parlando dal microfono del telefono, e non ci sente male come se stessimo usando cuffie da stessa fascia di prezzo.
Buojna, invece, la soppressione del rumore per chi ci ascolta.
Manca un'app dedicata che permetta di fare qualche regolazione.
In sostanza: le consiglierei?
Sì per la fascia di prezzo, no se volete un prodotto che, quando lo usate, vi renda contenti dell'acquisto effettuato.
Ossia: fanno il loro, ma ho voglia di comprare nuovamente Samsung o Apple (il problema è che perdo cuffie in continuazione e non posso lasciare reni in giro per avere audio).
È un po' come dover cambiare auto e prendere l'alternativa economia a quella che vorreste.
Avrete un'auto che va, ma ogni volta che passerete davanti al concessionario, sbaverete per quella che avreste realmente voluto.
Come spesso accade Xiaomi fa, come si dice dalle mie parti, ""una scarpa ed una ciabatta"".
Per questo periodo di spiaggia, vacanze, e posti in cui dimenticarle sempre, direi che sono l'acquisto doveroso. Questo inverno, vedremo."
"Muy disgustado porque hoy recibí el paquete y llegó la pura caja, sin ningún accesorio y tampoco el manual"
"Calidad-precio son un acierto de decisión. Se escuchan fenomenal, si tú móvil es encima de la misma marca es un plus en la conexión. Dura muchísimo la batería, son cómodos y una buena conexión bluetooth."
"Prix excellent mais nettement moins bon que les anciens modèles

Le son lors d'une discussion n'est vraiment pas terrible et il y a des craquements, en plus ils ne sont pas très bons au niveau de la distance de l'appareil, à 3 m il coupent."
"After a month of use, the left one stopped working. And I don't use them very often. Max an hour a day on the way to work"
Bigger than I thought
"En conduisant, meme en mettant le volume a fond, le son reste moyen
il faut appuyer a fond sur les ecouteurs pour ressentir la musique, et la ca commence a faire mal au cartilage de loreille.

bref , c'est pas mal pour un usage court."
Vorher hatte ich die Redmi Buds 3 und war daher gute Qualität gewohnt. Leider entsprachen diese Buds nicht ganz meinen Vorstellungen. Sie sitzen meiner Meinung nach sehr locker im Ohr und auch die Lautstärke war nicht wirklich gut.
"Me han sorprendido muy gratamente, se los regale a mi padre y cuando se los emparejé al móvil y los probé me quedé sorprendido.

Cuando te los colocas en los oídos se conectan automáticamente y bastante rápido, la calidad del audio y del micro es bastante buena aunque creo que no tiene supresor de ruido o aislamiento como otras marcas más tope de gama, pero para el uso que él le va a dar está más que bien.

Son cómodos y no se andan saliendo como los antiguos airdots de botón, así que puedes salir a correr despreocupado.

Referente a la batería no sabría decir pero con un uso diario de un par de horas aguantan al menos 3-5 días cargándose en su estuche perfectamente.

En resumen, cuestan 10 veces menos que los de la marca que ya sabéis y no hay tanta diferencia en cuanto a calidad se refiere."
"Ho recentemente avuto l'opportunità di provare gli auricolari Bluetooth Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 Lite e sono rimasto estremamente soddisfatto delle loro prestazioni e funzionalità.

Prima di tutto, devo sottolineare la cancellazione del rumore AI integrata. Questa caratteristica è incredibilmente efficace nel bloccare il rumore di fondo, consentendomi di immergermi completamente nella mia musica o nelle chiamate senza distrazioni. I suoni vengono resi in modo chiaro e nitido, offrendo un'esperienza audio di alta qualità.

Inoltre, la possibilità di caricare gli auricolari tramite wireless è stata una sorpresa gradita. Questa funzione mi ha permesso di eliminare il fastidio dei cavi durante la ricarica e mi ha permesso di godermi la comodità e la praticità della ricarica senza fili.

La durata della batteria è un altro grande vantaggio di questi auricolari. Con una durata di circa 20 ore, posso usarli per tutta la giornata senza preoccuparmi di doverli ricaricare costantemente. Questo è particolarmente apprezzato quando mi trovo in viaggio o quando sono impegnato in attività che richiedono un uso prolungato degli auricolari.

Inoltre, apprezzo molto la connessione Google Veloce che mi permette di collegarmi rapidamente e senza complicazioni al mio dispositivo Android. La stabilità della connessione è straordinaria e non ho mai riscontrato interruzioni o problemi di connessione durante l'utilizzo degli auricolari.

La qualità del suono offerta dai driver dinamici da 12mm è semplicemente eccezionale. I bassi sono potenti e profondi, mentre gli acuti sono nitidi e chiari. Sia che stia ascoltando musica, guardando film o partecipando a chiamate, l'esperienza audio è sempre piacevole e coinvolgente.

Infine, la resistenza all'acqua IP54 è un dettaglio che non posso trascurare. So di poterli utilizzare senza problemi durante attività sportive o sotto la pioggia senza timore che si danneggino a causa dell'umidità.

In sintesi, sono estremamente soddisfatto degli auricolari Bluetooth Xiaomi Redmi Buds 4 Lite. Offrono un audio di alta qualità, una durata della batteria eccezionale, funzioni avanzate come la cancellazione del rumore AI e la ricarica wireless, nonché una connessione stabile e veloce. Consiglio vivamente questi auricolari a chiunque sia alla ricerca di un'esperienza audio completa e conveniente."
"Erst ganz toll. Etwas zu leicht vom Gefühl her, aber nach 3 Monaten lässt die Leistung links sehr nach."
Renvoyé
I am happy with product.
"Buon prodotto, la batteria è durevole e il suono è discreto. Purtroppo il volume non è ottimale e risultano troppo grandi all'interno delle orecchie. Alla lunga danno fastidio."
"El diseño es un poco grande y rígido con lo que no se ajusta bien a la oreja.
El sonido es muy bueno pero las funcionalidades son un poco limitadas, solo puedes pausar la reproducción con dos toques y cambiar a la siguiente canción con tres toques, por lo que he podido averiguar hasta ahora 😔
Me costó mucho para poder conectarlos con mis dispositivos.
Las instrucciones son menos que básicas y tuve que investigar por mi cuenta a ver cómo lograba conectarlos y cómo usarlos. Me parece que el manual de usuario debería dar más detalles sobre el uso y funcionalidades.
Soy fan de la marca, llevo usando teléfonos Xiaomi desde hace varios años y me parece estupendos, por lo que esperaba un poco más de estos auriculares, aunque nuevamente recalco que el sonido es fabuloso."
"I’ve been using the Redmi Buds 4 Lite for over a year now, and overall, I’m quite impressed, especially considering the price. They deliver great audio quality for phone calls and general listening, making them a solid choice for everyday use. While the sound quality is good for music, it’s important to note that the bass isn’t particularly strong. But for casual listening, the sound is clear and enjoyable.

The microphone performs well, too, which is great for calls. However, if you’re in a noisy environment, you’ll need to crank up the volume, as there’s no active noise cancellation. This can be a bit of a drawback if you frequently use them in loud settings.

One of the standout features is the battery life. Even after a year of regular use, the battery still holds up well, lasting long enough for extended listening sessions. Pairing with my mobile phone via Bluetooth is seamless, and the connection remains stable.

Comfort is another plus. They fit well in my ears, and there are times I forget I’m even wearing them. However, the touch controls can be tricky. I’ve found myself accidentally pausing the audio and then struggling to play it again without resorting to my phone.

In conclusion, these earphones are a fantastic value for the price."
works well
Very good for the price and easy to use. Paired instantly.
5 Tage im Dauerregen im Gras gelegen und funktioniert noch immer. Das waren 150 Liter pro m2. Bei dem Preis - was willst du mehr. Ton ist für Podcasts etc. ausreichend.
"Lo bueno es la calidad precio y la compatibilidad.

Pesa mucho que al ser xiaomi enlaza con todo facilmente, la bateria dura mucho por el precio.

Ahora bien la calidad de sonido es mejorable, pero por 14 euros es muy buena por el precio."
"Premesso che io non ho un ""udito raffinato"" e che li utilizzo quasi esclusivamente per ascoltare audiolibri, li trovo molto comodi, anche indossati per ore non irritano ne stancano il padiglione auricolare. Sono dotati di buona autonomia grazie alla custodia con batteria incorporata, si collegano facilmente, si ricaricano in poco tempo e considerato il prezzo veramente contenuto sono un ottimo prodotto.
L'unica pecca è la scarsità di comandi diretti che però si possono inviare dal telefono o dallo Smartwatch.
Per me Xiaomi è sempre una garanzia."
Très satisfait
"Le cuffie sono economiche le uso da qualche mese principalmente per ascoltare musica. Per ora funzionano bene e l'audio non è male anzi. La durata delle batterie è buona, funzionano per parecchie ore di ascolto, sono arrivato a 3 senza problemi. Giudizio complessivo buono almeno per ore, visto anche il prezzo. spero che altrettanto buona sia la durata"
"Uniche cuffie che nonostante le numerose cadute continuano ad andare perfettamente.
Batteria ottima.
Unico difetto, a volte diventano scomode durate l'allenamento in quanto tendono a scivolare con il sudore."
"Los compramos para mi mujer, los usa mientras viaja en tren diariamente y le han resultado muy buenos. Buen sonido, las baterías le duran bastante. Está conforme con ellos"
"Llevo solo unos días con los auriculares. Buen tamaño y peso, se sujetan en las orejas. Sin embargo el volumen es muy bajo en el móvil (en el ordenador mejor), PERO AQUÍ ESTÁ LA SOLUCIÓN.
Para los móvil Xiaomi: vete a ajustes adicionales de tu teléfono, pon la región en San Marino (en vez de España) y reinicia el móvil. Parece el típico truco que no va a funcionar pero después de revisarme varios foros lo he hecho y funciona perfecto.
Por lo visto es por la normativa de los países a los volúmenes..."
Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo
"Llevo unos días con ellos,y he de decir que para el precio tan ajustado que tienen, emiten un buen sonido.De batería aguantan un montón .Traen cable USB para cargar."
Boa qualidade de som e facilidade de emparelhar com o telefone.
"Sin simplemente geniales, disfruto de escuchar música con una gran calidad de sonido, buena duración de batería.
Ya los tengo desde hace muchos meses y los uso mucho.
Los recomiendo"
"Pratici e veloci nella ricarica e nella connessione. Si appoggiano nell'incavo inferiore dell'orecchio, senza necessità di gommini adattatori per il canale auricolare. Dunque facili da indossare, ma non adatti se ci si muove durante l'ascolto. Qualità sonora nella media."
"Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo, svolgono il proprio lavoro senza intoppi. La batteria dura più che a sufficienza e il case molto piccolo rende le cuffie facilmente trasportabili."
En otros cascos de otras marcas e tenido el problema de la caraga y de reconocimento entre los cascos y la cajita de carga... pero estos llevan un iman que agara bien! No creo de volver a tener el mismo problema
"Podrían tener un mejor sonido, pero para lo que me costaron tampoco me puedo quejar. Pequeños y se conectan rápido. Los quería en negro porque ya tengo otros en blanco."
"Por la calidad y el precio de este producto he quedado muy satisfecho, lo recomiendo 100%"
Buen sonido y manejo sencillo.
"Se oye bien, aunque lo tengo que poner en casi horizontal para que se oiga perfectamente, poco a poco se va callendo y pierdes potencia."
"Vale lo que cuesta, son sencillos, pequeños y potentes. Tenía otros de este tipo y el micrófono era malísimo, con estos puedo enviar notas de voz mejores, se nota la diferencia y casi no se me caen, ha pasado pocas veces"
"Relación calidad precio inigualable, pero para mí oído era demasiado grande"
Der Ton ist klar und Anrufe können nicht über den Kopfhörer entgegengenommen werden
"Todo bien en líneas generales, si pudiese cambiarle algo añadiría algo más de volumen."
Muy buen producto a muy buen precio.
"Enlazan perfectamente en Oppo A53, sonido bueno y batería más que correcta."
"Son el segundo par que tengo porque me los dejo, pero repito porque no puedo vivir sin ellos. La batería me dura bastante. Pero el micro no es el mejor, sobretodo cuando estás en la calle, para llamadas más o menos, pero los audios se oyen terrible"
Todo correcto faltan instrucciones
Se adaptan bien y el sonido es bueno pero tienen poco volumen
Se escuchan decentemente para el precio que tienen y la duración de la batería es buena.
Auriculares bastante comodos que tienen un sonido muy aceptable para su precio. La duracion de la bateria es buena y la carga normalita. La marca es signo de buen producto siempre.
"Eu recebi este produto hoje. Fiz alguns testes e essa é minha avaliação:

É um fone de ouvido bom, ele é elegante e conecta bem rápido, graças ao Fast Connect. Apenas 4 a 7 segundos (de acordo com meus testes) com a caixa aberta (sem tirar os fones da caixa), e os fones conectaram. Além disso, o cancelamento de ruído apenas para chamadas dele é ótimo, e a bateria parece durar o necessário para um usuário comum

Agora, tem a parte ruim do fone:
Primeiro que, ele não tem aplicativo próprio. Isso dificulta muito a personalização que seria uma adição ótima.
O fone também não faz a animação de conexão que eu supostamente vi ao pesquisar sobre o fone. Eu acho que a animação aparece dependendo do modelo do celular (eu uso um Redmi Note 11S 5G)
Pra terminar, o fone simplismente não se conecta bem. Por agora, eu não culpo o fone, já que ainda é o primeiro dia de uso. Mas o dia inteiro, de todas as vezes que eu usei, ele escorregava do ouvido 5 minutos depois de colocar.

Em resumo, é um fone decente que tem um ou outro problema, depende do quão exigente você é. Eu recomendo comprar o QCY T13 se você estiver com 30€ de orçamento. Nunca usei o T13 mas pesquisei sobre e descobri que ele tem muitos mais altos e baixos do que o Buds 4 Lite.

Minha avaliação final é 3,5/5, mas como a Amazon não deixa escolher a metade de uma estrela, vou deixar como 4. Se a minha experiência mudar (negativamente) nos próximos dias ou semanas, talvez eu tenha de abaixar para 3 estrelas."
Gostei de tudo
"I found the size of the earbuds perfect, because they fitted perfectly to my ear. I could wear them for hours and it does not hurt at any moment. The batterie lasts a lot of time and it does not take long to charge. The only thing I am not very satisfied with, is that the volume is pretty low. I normally have to put it above the middle to listen to normal music."
Top product.
Impecável
Ottime na unico neo la durata in ascolto che non supera le 2 ore se non riposte nella custodia
"Me facina su diseño, calidad y estilo. Maravilloso sonido y demasiado accesible por su precio."
Por el precio están muy bien y son cómodos
"simples e eficaz
só dá para um dispositivo de cada vez, mas pelo preço é perfeito"
"Parece me muito bom, agora deixar passar os tempos para ver como se portam"
"Extraño alguna luz de carga, por lo demás bien"
"parece increible la calidad de sonido y de graves que tienen comparados con productos mas caros.
totalmente recomendables"
"Los compré para un Redmi Note 11 y fue un acierto. Es muy buen producto para el precio que tiene. Se sincronizan al instante y automáticamente, la calidad de sonido es muy buena y la batería dura bastante más de lo que cabría esperar. Desconozco si son compatibles con marcas que no sean Xiaomi, pero si es así repetiré con los ojos cerrados."
"Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo , unico difetto rilevante le dimensioni a causa delle quali a lungo andare danno un po' fastidio."
"Son bastantes cómodos de llevar aunque cuando se está haciendo deporte se suelen caer por el sudor. El sonido se escucha bastante bien pero hay veces que hay que ponerlo bastante altos si no quieres estar todo el rato colocándolo bien en la oreja. La batería dura poco para mi gusto pero más o menos como marca las características. Como digo, tienen buena calidad precio para lo que cuestan"
Dura un montón
Buenos
Excelente relação qualidade preco
Muy bueno el producto
"those are not 35 bucks Earbuds. the quality sound is terrible, the finish feels like cheap low quality plastic, the battery of the left earbud just lasts like 3 hours. look somewhere else and get something better"
"I don’t know what to say. I order third pair after I put them on charger, case stop changing headphones without connecting to Connecting to charging. But headphones are good"

"Estos auriculares inalámbricos pueden ser una excelente opción para aquellos que buscan un par de auriculares de calidad a un precio asequible. Con una calidad de sonido HD y una duración de batería de 18 horas, estos auriculares ofrecen una buena relación calidad-precio. Además, su resistencia al agua IPX4 los hace ideales para usar durante el ejercicio o en días lluviosos.

Aunque no he podido probar su resistencia al agua personalmente, sí puedo decir que son cómodos de usar y fáciles de emparejar con otros dispositivos por Bluetooth. Además, tienen un botón de control que permite pausar la reproducción y cambiar de canción con facilidad. También me gusta mucho su diseño en color azul, que es atractivo y diferente.

En general, si buscas unos auriculares inalámbricos a un precio asequible sin comprometer la calidad de sonido y la duración de batería, los Xiaomi Redmi Buds Essential pueden ser una buena opción. Su resistencia al agua y su facilidad de uso los convierten en una excelente alternativa para aquellos que buscan auriculares para el ejercicio o para los días lluviosos."
I had ear pain due to too much heat
"Excelente producto, muy buen sonido"
Ich brauche es nur um mein Traker zu hören beim Joggen… dafür ist gut.
"No trae cargador pero sí es original. Los compré porque perdí mis airpods y no quería volver a gastar. El sonido no le llega pero tampoco está mal, es aceptable su mayor atributo es la comodidad, los otros (airpods) me llegaron a sacar sangre e irritar, los recomiendo para hacer ejercicio porque no rebotan, no pesan y no sé despegan de ningún lado por el sudor.
Los he conectado a Apple y a Redmi y en ninguna me notifica sobre la pila.. eso es lo único"
Calidad de sonido y cómodos
The case stopped charging after 6 months
"I have mi earphones before and I am glad with the product, about this one specific; it is no more no less than it is advertised on the page and the colour is nice"
"Good product ,comfortable to use ,lasting charge ,especially very good for call ,original sound for call ,audio and all ."
"Die Akku lauf Zeit ist schlecht und saund ist wie meine Alte Oma die singt und dann kein USB C und die Verarbeitung ist zum Mäusemelken schlecht 🙄
Ich kann sie nicht weiter empfehlen"
Los auriculares bien pero no vienen con cable de carga.
"El sonido no es el mejor, pero si buscas algo muy básico es bueno por el precio.
Tienen 3 diferentes tamaños de gomas. Elegí las mas pequeñas y al paso de 1-2 hrs si molesta un poco, pero depende de la forma de tu oido.
Durante el ejercicio no se caen, solo que para cambiar de cancion tienes que presionar el audifono y el sonido de ""clic"" es molesto.

Y un dato extra, por descuido se fueron en la ropa a la lavadora y después de 1 ciclo de lavado y 2 hrs en la lavadora sobrevivieron XD"
"هاتف المستخدم شاومى
ممتازه من حيث الصوت الهادى الغير مؤذى للاذن
بطاريه تدوم كثير وصغيره الحجم
عيوبها طبعا مفيش عزل ضوضاء وده طبيعى للسعر
البوكس لو فصل شحن السماعه مش هتقدر تفصلها من الهاتف هتعملها unpair"
Sesi aşırı iyi değil ama fiyat performans ürünü
"Ich habe Xiaomi vor 2 Jahren gekauft und war ich sehr zufrieden aber die Kopfhörer sind ganz anders,total Schrott"
"He usado varias versiones de este mismo modelo, y lo sigo comprando. Cómodos y sencillos, el botón físico es ideal, no falla, con guantes, mojado, con los auriculares de seguridad... Calidad/precio, los mejores"
Good product
Excelente producto. Largo alcance de Bluetooth. Excelente aislamiento de ruido
Ótimo produto
"Tuve mala suerte de perder un audífono a la semana de haberlos comprado, pero mientras los use el sonido fue muy bueno y con buen volumen. Los ocupe para el traslado al trabajo (1 hora aprox.) y nunca tuve que cargarlos, durante esa semana se mantuvieron al 100% de carga obviamente los volveré a comprar!!"
.
They Sound Very Good and I would 100% recommend this to everyone
"calidad-precio muy bien, lo unico malo es que se escucha demasiado bajo... y no trae su cable cargador"
"Jamais pu l'utiliser, un côté ne change pas.Remboursement effectué par Amazon...ils ont été sympa en me disant de garder l'article et ils m'ont remboursé très rapidement ..cet écouteur à sûrement un défaut de fabrication"
"Para escuchar no te deja subir el volumen a un nivel normal, se escucha muy bajito y no conseguí hablar por teléfono ni una vez, no se me escuchaba."
Confortáveis e bom som.
"No se caen, no se mueven de lugar, he corrido con ellos & permanecen en su lugar todo el tiempo, excelente volumen... no viene con cargador para el estuche. La batería duró una semana, con uso de aprox 1 a 3 horas diarias. Se conectan automáticamente al sacarlos del estuche."
"Good price, great quality, lovely colour"
"Es básico, no muestra la cantidad de batería pero dura mas de un día, me resulta muy cómodo.
Trae 3 opciones para elegir la que mejor se adapte a tu oído, un sonido decente y las llamadas excelente en el microfono también.
No los he utilizado para correr aún, pero para yoga divinos, no se salen ni me duelen."
"Relación calidad/precio son perfectos. Se escucha genial, y son Fáciles de utilizar. La batería dura bastante"
"وزنها و الشحن كويسين
اللي نعجبنيش خد عندك
اولا مفيش سلك شاحن و لا شاحن معا ان ليهم مكان ف العلبه و دة معناه انو تم اخراجهم قبل البيع
السعر فوق 700 و مفيش عازل للضوضاء و كل الاصوات اللي حواليه طالعه ف المكالمه يعني سماعه عادي ب 100 جنيه هيكون فيها عازل احسن من كدا
كان المفروض ارجعها تاني بسبب العزل بذات
بس بلا عدي الوقت اللي مش هيفرق معاه مووضع العذل يشتريها"
"Conoscevo già il prodotto
L' ho ricomprato perché ho avuto problemi con un auricolare.
Ad ogni modo considerato il modo in cui li utilizzava mio figlio sono abbastanza soddisfatta.
Mi dispiace che i tempi di consegna non siano stati rispettati, infatti sono arrivati oggi"
"Este prudo vendido por preciosya, finalmente se me devolvió el dinero atendiendo a mi petición de que no quería un producto nuevo y reparado."
Mi piace tutto
"Eu tinha um Bud 4 que usei por quase 2 anos, mas que infelizmente foram roubados. Sabendo que este era de uma gama mais antiga e baixa, decidi tentar mesmo assim, considerando que gosto muito dos produtos Xiaomis. Esquece, já não os uso para nada. A qualidade do som é inferior, a ergonomia é pior, não encaixam tão confortáveis como os Buds 4, e quebraram ao simplesmente tentar tirar da caixa para utilizar no 5° dia. Ok, talvez não tenha sido a mais delicada só fazê-lo, mas relembro que já tive um Bud 4 que nunca apresentou qualquer resistência ou dificuldade de manuseio, uso, etc.

Fiquei mesmo desiludida, é jogar dinheiro fora. Comprem uma gama mais recente, pelo menos duram mais e servem muito melhor!!"
"A pesar de ser económicos estan muy bien, el sonido es bueno y la duración de la batería también. Son cómodos aunque en mi caso he tenido que probar con varias almoadillas del oido ya que se me iba cayendo poco a poco.

No los he probado corriendo o haciendo deporte ya que no me fío mucho de que puedan aguantar agarrados ya que son un poco grande, quizás sea problema de que no me agarren bien en la oreja.

El micrófono es decente pero hace su función."
Pedido correcto
"Il prodotto ha un buon rapporto qualità prezzo però nella confezione non è presente il cavo di ricarica, andrebbe aggiunto."
Belle esteticamente ma non riesco a farle connettere in bluetooth
"Funciona bien lo de que venga sin cable de carga no me lo esperaba unos cutres,dos meses han durado una castaña no los compréis TIMO gordo"
"Ottime cuffie, carine nell'aspetto e molto funzionali."
"Funziona bene, ma se avete bisogno di una cuffia che resti carica per molto tempo, questa non è la ideale. anche il caricatore si scarica nel giro di 3 o 4gg"
"Ottimo il rapporto qualità prezzo
Indossabilità ottima,
Batteria principale per la ricarica delle cuffie non molto resistente"
Cumplen con su funcion y más con celular xiaomi los ame
Defeito
"La verdad pedí dos y solo funcionaron un par, mala calidad"
Sono molto pratici. Si agganciano rapidamente al bluetooth. La batteria dura quasi un giorno intero.
"Son muy buenos y casi en cuanto lo sacas del estuche se conectan, solo que si los usas por más de unos 30 minutos empiezan a doler los oídos"
De momento todo bien.
"Utilice 5 veces los audífonos y después ya no funcionaron las ultimas 2 veces que los utilice observe que primero no funciono el derecho y después ya no funciono el izquierdo, puse una reclamación de retorno 2 veces y el vendedor no me dio respuesta."
Preço bastante competitivo e resultado acima do esperado. Boa compra qualidade/preços
"Me gustaron, son prácticos y la pila dura suficiente.
Lo único es que no tienen suficiente volumen."
Manca il cavo
"Me sorpre dio lo mucho que dura la batería, lo único que no me gustó es que no trae el cable para cargar, tuve que conseguir uno, sin embargo todo bien. Funcionan muy bien hasta ahora."
"Muy buenos y todo pero los audífonos llegaron sellados pero sin el cable de carga.

Mal ahí."
Es buen producto en relación precio calidada
Son geniales i La batería 🔋 dura un par días usándolo 10 horas trabajando
"Cuando hago uso de los auriculares a veces uno de ellos deja de funcionar por algunos segundos, aun cuando está muy cerca el teléfono."
Excelente sonido y muy práctico
"Es un artículo que si se obtienen en menos de $300 mx los recomiendo, pero son unos audifo que no son compatibles con las apps oficiales de xiaomi por lo cual no se pueden actualizar y tampoco configurar su audio"
"Los audífonos están muy bonitos y el tamaño es muy amigable para guardar en todos lados. Físicamente, están muy bonitos. Pero… la calidad del audio es mala, comparándolos con audífonos STF (calidad similar) estos audífonos suenan de muy baja calidad, la música suena lejos, pésimos para usar en llamada, dan mucho que desear. el audífono no se acomoda muy bien a la oreja sin importar el tamaño de almohadilla que uses. Hay mejores audífonos de precio similar en el mercado."
El volumen es muy bajo
"Les falta un poco más de volumen y cancelación de ruido, pero están muy bien por el precio 🤷"
Que no marca la porcentaje de batería simpre marca 100%
"Cuffie fantastiche, xiaomi sempre top, ho aspettato un pó a recensirle, ma mi sono trovata benissimo, si sentono bene in strada, in chiamata sempre. Consigliatissime"
"Tienen muy buena calidad, solo no existe una app para manejar las configuraciones de los audífonos..."
"No me gusta los tenga que guardar y sacar de nuevo, en caso de que se desconecten demasiado tiempo."
"por el precio es lo que esperaba, no me decepcionaron"
"Por el precio esperaba más del producto, buen sonido, hay audífonos más baratos y mejores"
"No es el sonido más envolvente, sin embargo por el precio cumple su función, la batería dura aproximadamente unas tres horas si los usas continuamente, no los recomiendo para ejercitarse, realmente no aíslan el ruido exterior."
اصلية و سعرها كويس، الصوت نقي بس مش أعلى حاجه.
مقارنة بسعرها هي كويسة بطارية و صوت لكن المايك مفهوش عازل ضوضاء و بيبقي الموضوع صعب في الدوشة ، حلوة للناس اللي بتلعب ببجي لانها فيها وضع العاب
"Como mencionan otros comentarios, no venían con cable de carga, buena calidad pero decepcionada que no tuviera el cable…"
صغيره وصوتها كويس والميك واضح
"Me llego en tiempo y forma, todo bien me gusta el sonido emitido, lo unicl que me aguito fue que dos dias despues de pedirlo estaba en 299 mientras que yo lo compre por 549🥲"
Por el precio es lo justo las llamadas se escuchan claritas
They are good but one is better than the other
Los auriculares son de muy buena calidad
"Debería incluir cargador, pero está muy bien de precio y el sonido es muy bueno."
"En general por el precio me parecieron buenos los audifonos, no soy un usuario exigente pero para el uso que les doy (llamadas telefónicas) me son de buena utilidad."
"Me gusto mucho su calidad, se escucha no tan fuerte pero suena bien, venía todo sellado, excelente."
"Compre unos y desde que llego, el audífono izquierdo no funciono por lo cual solicite la devolución. También el sonido lo note muy débil y de muy baja la calidad del audio (parecieran audífonos que te regalan en los aviones).

Así que si te llegan funcionales, el precio puede ser bueno ""calidad-precio"" pero si eres que te gusta una buena calidad de audio te recomendaría otros que tiene un precio un poco mas alto(pero sin necesidad de llegar a audífonos premium)

Espero y te sirva el comentario para tu compra. :P"
"Son unos earbuds muy básicos, que para operarlos ya puestos resulta algo doloroso, además de que el aprejamiento con el teléfono, aunque sea redmi, puede tardar mucho o ser de inmediato, no es consistente. La calidad del sonido y la falta de prestaciones es lo esperable por el precio."
"Me han servido mucho, los recomiendo."
Cumplen muy bien su función
La.verdad que por el precio es bastante bueno te dirán unas 5 horas de música cómodos y fáciles de usar
"Si lo que buscas son audífonos para escuchar música, estos no son los indicados. Su calidad es bastante mala. Yo tuve que poner un equalizador, porque el audio predeterminado lástima y te da dolor de cabeza (esto sin volumen alto, sólo es malo y ya). La verdad no los recomiendo. Hay mejores opciones al mismo precio."
"Todo bien, llegó en tiempo y forma, lo único malo es que no viene con cable de carga"
Fanno il loro mestiere
"Creí que me enviarían unos piratas pero llegaron originales, me gustaron muchísimo
El proveedor envió y llego de manera rápida, de 10 👌🏻"
Esta demasiado frágil el contenedor de los audífonos.
"Muy buena calidad de sonido, son bastante cómodos y el estuche lo suficientemente pequeño para poder llevarlo en el bolsillo sin problemas"
Todo perfecto lo único malo es q no tiene indicadores de porcentaje de pila
"Los compramos porque me los recomendó una amiga,estamos contentos con ellos.
Calidad precio está bien los recomiendo"
Es un Excelente producto ya que su precio es accesible vale la pena cómpralo
نوعا ما مقبوله لكن لاتشمل ملحقات
"I have purchased 2 pairs of these headphones. I thought I had lost the first set, and decided to purchase them again base d on the overall performance.

I had purchased the black color (same style as the second pair) originally, but decided to go with the blue pair the second purchase.

My notion was, if I happen to find the black pair ( I did happen to find them) I could differenciate the sets by color.

I usually wear one at work because I am required to hear people and noises around me. They function very well with only one being utilized at a time, but I would say you do have to trade all functionality for finger to headphone operation.

Flaws:

The left side turns the volume down, the right has volume up function. The left side adujusts songs back to previous song, the right jumps to the next song. Other functions correlate with the same premise.

I would like to adjust the functionality by assigning them to my preference and style of listening. I downloaded the app in hopes I could do something like this. I am not. In fact, the headphones tout you may adjust the equalizer within the app.

The truth is, I downloaded the app, but was unsuccessful with using the equalizer at all. Every attempt I made to assign the equalizer was repeatedly received with the message stating ""device not compatible."" Note: the options from other users for equalizer settings was available, but when attempting to assign, I received the message as stated above

Another problem with the app is preset specific equalizers for music, speech, instrumental, etc... were not options. The only way to get equalizers was to utilize the settings other app users presented, or to develop your own. I don't have the time, ear, or knowledge of equalizer/soundwaives to do all of that. I know basics like Hip Hope uses a lot of bass, Heavy Metal, more treble, my basic knowledge is not good enough for my personal devlopment.

Future App Development, AKA App developer:

I just want to pick Jazz, or Audio book, or Classical/Instrumental equalizers and the like by selecting a preset.

Positives:
Headphones sound exellent with the regular equalizer settings.

Waterproof (I accidentally wore them in the shower) but must advise not to put wet earphones in the case-charger.

I like the ability to adjust the earphones in and out, up and down.
The earphones are comfortable.

The black and blue colored ones are gender neutral.

The case holds a 40 hour charge, and the earphones will sustain 12 hours of continual use. I usually listen with them for around 8 hours while I work.

The connection within the charging case is wonderful.

The Bluetooth connection is easy and is listed as Tozo. Once they are connected, within Bluetooth a message expains device is paired to phone, and music.

While using only one headphone, I am able to answer my phone, and disconnect. I can also hear when notifications like texts arrive. I don't often check my phone, hear, or feel vibration when I receive a text and it may take a whole day before I discover I received one. The phone helps me check the phone more often, when I may be needed.

I really like how easy pressing the earphones is. I often have to touch them to pause my amazon music stream while I interact with other people at work. One touch, pauses the thing and another unpauses.

When I wear them while mowing my lawn or tilling, I can hear the music while the motor noise is diminished substanially. I love that.

Overall:

I wish I could program the functions into each headphone.
Standard Equalizer needs to offer professional manufuactured options (not only other users equalizer preferences and development.

You really have to listen to a lot with the music you enjoy to find one that works. Too much work in my opinion.

Was unable to connect the headphones to even another users equalizer offerings.

I really like these."
"It's been quite a ride trying to find a wireless pair of headphones for running and working out. Every in-ear bud I've had has had one ear go out - which I think is more of a me issue than the buds that I've tried. Even the buds that just sit in the ear have died on me after a few months.

I've had the TOZO O2 open ear buds for about 8 months now and they've been great. You aren't getting ""premium"" sound, but what you do get is actually pretty good. It's bassy and full sounding but a little muddled compared to in-ear options. What is really nice is that you can hear your surroundings quite well. This is great for jogging or working out, or even listening to music in an office while you want to be able to hear what's going on around you. The only problem is if you are running on a busy street you really have to crank the volume to hear your music. The sound quality is clearly a step above the many budget buds I've tried.

The TOZO True Open Ear buds are also extremely comfortable. They adjust to whatever position you need them in, and I've forgotten that I had them on sometimes. Like I mentioned, they have worked great for working out. No fear of them falling out, no issues with light rain or sweat. The best workout set I've used.

Call quality is good and no one seems to have a hard time hearing me, so no complaints there.

I did run into an issue where a piece of the plastic on the joint between the over ear piece and the bud broke. This is a little disappointing but I use the buds almost daily, and often in less than ideal conditions. Even with this issue, this is the longest lasting TWS bud I've had in years. Functionally, the unit still works but I was concerned about the water resistance, so I reached out to customer support. Customer service responded in less than 12 hours and is shipping out a replacement unit. 5* support right there.

When I'm already convinced I like the product, and customer support is top notch on top of that? A very, very easy recommendation from me."
"I recently purchased the Tozo O2 open earbuds, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed. These earbuds redefine comfort and audio quality without breaking the bank. Let's break down why these are my new go-to for everyday listening:

**Sound Quality:** The sound clarity and richness are exceptional, especially considering their open-ear design. The mids are crisp, the highs are clear, and even the bass holds its own, providing a surprisingly balanced audio experience.

**Comfort:** Comfort is where the Tozo O2 truly shines. The open-ear design means no more ear fatigue or that plugged feeling after hours of use. They sit comfortably on the ears without any pressure, making them perfect for extended wear during workouts, walks, or long commutes.

**Design & Build:** Sleek and minimalistic, these earbuds look and feel premium. The build quality is impressive for the price point, and they feel sturdy yet lightweight. They're also water-resistant, which is a huge plus for active users.

**Battery Life:** I've been pleasantly surprised by the battery life. They easily last through a full day of moderate use, and the quick charging feature is a lifesaver when I'm in a rush.

**Connectivity:** Pairing was effortless, and the Bluetooth connection has been stable throughout. I've had no issues with dropouts, even in crowded areas.

**Value for Money:** Considering the sound quality, comfort, and features packed into these earbuds, the Tozo O2 is an absolute steal. You're getting premium-level performance without the premium price tag.

**Overall Impression:** Whether you're a music enthusiast, a podcast addict, or someone who just appreciates good audio quality on the go, the Tozo O2 open earbuds deliver in spades. They combine impressive sound, comfort, and affordability in a way that's hard to beat. Highly recommended!

---

In conclusion, the Tozo O2 open earbuds offer a superb audio experience at a fraction of the cost of other high-end brands, making them a smart choice for anyone looking to upgrade their listening experience without breaking the bank."
"I am looking for an Open Headphone to replace my in-ear buds. After comparing the advantages and disadvantages of SHOKZ and other Bone Conduction headphones, I choose the TOZO Open Ear， an Air Conduction.
There are some amazing things about this open-ear headset, but there are also some shortcomings that I find very frustrating.
First, the pros:
1: Very comfortable to wear. During the six hours of continuous wearing, I didn't even know I was wearing headphones if it wasn't for the music still playing in my ears, I'm a glass wearer, but the ear-hanging design doesn't prevent me from wearing glasses. Comfortable to wear, in a couple of days, there has been no case of headphones falling, and only in the fifth and sixth days of use, I do feel a little discomfort in the ear. Light, fully customized Angle adjustment for comfortable wear. This one is rated 4.5/5

2: Sound quality. I am amazed at the sound quality. I do not expect such excellent sound quality for this kind of air-conduction headphones, especially for the bass. This one is rated 5/5

3: Microphone. The quality of the microphone is quite good, in the actual use of the process, in the noisy road, warehouse, machine conveyor belt, and another high-noise environment, the other party can hear my voice, and told me that environmental noise is not serious, visible microphone noise reduction does play a role. This one is rated 5/5

4: TOZO APP. The TOZO APP provides additional handling and sound quality features for certain models of headphones, increasing the added value of these headphones. What I appreciate most is that you can customize the touch function in the APP, or directly disable the touch function, which has the same function as Samsung buds. This function is very useful. For example, I will completely disable the touch function, so as to prevent misoperation caused by rain drops on the touch panel outdoors in rainy days. Unfortunately, the EQ adjustment options of Open Ear in TOZO APP are very limited, which is quite different compared with other TOZO products, such as TOZO Openreal, which is also Air Conduction. This one is rated 4/5

5: Customer service. TOZO APP provides a customer service function, through which you can directly report problems in use to customer service and try to find solutions. Although not all problems or faults can be solved by customer service, my personal satisfaction with customer service is still relatively high, compared with the customer service of more than 10 different brands of headphones I have purchased. In this category, I think TOZO's customer service can get 4.5/5

Now for the cons:
1: The battery case does not provide a wireless charging function, which feels very regrettable, because as such beautifully designed and high-quality headphones, the battery case can only be charged through the plug, and the battery case does not have a battery remaining display, the user does not know the percentage of battery remaining. This one is rated 3.5/5

2: Headphones battery life. After the headphones are fully charged, their battery life is not as the official publicity, which is Up to 12 hours of playback on one charge. However, in my actual use process, the battery of one side of the headphones will run out randomly after about 5 to 6 hours. Yes, it is random. For example, this time, both my headphones are fully charged, and the APP shows that the power of both the left and right sides is 100%, and then playback continues. About 5-6 hours later, the battery of one side of the headphones still had about 30%~40% power, but the other side's battery was almost dead. When you put both headphones into the battery case to charge again and connect the USB-C to charge the battery case at the same time, even if it lasts for a whole night when you use it the next day, it is likely to prompt the other side of the headphones to run out of power after about 5 hours of use and observe the APP again, the other side of the headphones still has about 30% to 40% of the power. No matter how many times you manually sync the left and right headphones by pressing both at the same time, you can't fix the problem. This one is rated 2/5

3: Bluetooth automatically reconnects. In some cases, the phone can be set to airplane mode for a few minutes, when the airplane mode is turned off, the TOZO open cannot automatically reconnect the phone, even if the connection is manually selected in the Bluetooth control of the phone, the only way is to put two headphones into the battery case, cover the battery case, and then open the battery case. The headset will successfully connect to the phone again. This one is rated 1/5

Combining the above eight items, the average score is 3.68, which is about the level of 4/5."
"A little background: I’ve been a fan of tozo since I tried out the a1 minis. They were my first set of wireless earbuds, and I honestly could have saved myself a lot of time and money if I just stuck with them instead of going on a journey / into the rabbit hole of trying to find a “perfect” set. While I did find some others I enjoy, the simple fact is that those A1 minis are the ONLY ones that stay in my ears. Fit has to come first for me. I currently have two sets and will continue to replace them as needed (just due to the natural battery drain over time with heavy use).

On to the review for this product:

I never really knew about the “open bud” concept, but as I am trying to get into a more active lifestyle, I both was looking for something that I could trust in the fit and would allow me to have more awareness of my surroundings if I’m taking some time to walk or run outdoors. I happened to come across these and because I’ve already had good experiences with tozo as well as the fact that they seemed to check all my boxes, I purchased them.

The price point I believe is more than fair, especially when compared to higher price-tag models that may or may not be “better”. I’ll always appreciate the affordability of these products and the frequent discounts offered.

The open ear concept again was not something I’d been familiar with, at least in the last two decades really; I was reminded of my days in school and on the bus wearing the simple headphones of the early aughts with a wrap-around design. We have (obviously) come a long way with audio technology since then. I wasn’t sure at all what to expect from this current iteration of that idea. The sound quality honestly blew me away. They seem able to maintain the generally (in my experience; I’m not an audiophile) much higher sound quality of over-ears vs wireless buds.

The fit is just about as customizable as it can get, and I’d imagine most people would not struggle with fit on these. For me, as someone with small ears that cannot seem to contain regular wireless buds (aside from the a1 minis) and one ear with a shattered cartilage deformity, I’m a tricky fit. If you’re used to the plugged sensation of in-ears, it can feel a bit strange at first, but they’re so easy to adjust and get them in the right position for you. Once on and adjusted, the freedom of not having something shoved into your ear canals is awesome. I will admit when wearing them for several hours I got a bit of an ache around the ear hooks, but that’s typical for me even just wearing sunglasses for an extended period of time. I’d say they’re no more intrusive than glasses, and they’re encased in foam for more comfort.

I had no issues with any sound leakage; perhaps at full volume that may happen but I never push the volume that high anyway. And again, the sound quality is fantastic imo. On par with any of my over-ears (admittedly I have not tried many of the very high-priced models, but I am more than pleased with these). That sound quality remains great while allowing you to hear what’s going on around you. Noise canceling has its place, but so does the open ear concept (oftentimes you’ll see ANC buds that have a transparency mode for this effect).

The case is great if not the most “stylish” or rugged in and of itself; the buds snap in securely without having to fiddle with anything as I often do with other buds. Those magnets are strong but not so much that taking them out of the case is difficult.

As far as battery life goes, I was ecstatic to see the long life advertised, and the one night I had them on all throughout / while sleeping, they still had some life left when I woke up. They may not quite reach what is stated but I’ve found that’s common for most wireless buds. 8 hours is plenty for me, and to be able to reach 10-12 if not the full 15 that was quoted is far superior to any buds I’ve owned before. But I never wore them for that long anyway, which brings me to the one issue I had, which was a bit of a static sound in the left bud that would start up when any audio was being played but would stop when the audio was paused.

I reached out to customer service about this and they guided me through troubleshooting options, and when we came to the conclusion that no troubleshooting could solve the issue, I was sent another pair, no strings attached. I am eagerly awaiting their arrival. I always got a response from their customer service agents within hours, maybe within a day at max, throughout the whole process. They were easy to work with, friendly, and understanding.

Overall I’d definitely recommend these. I considered docking a star due to the static issue, but customer service was so great that I don’t feel it’s necessary to do so.

I’m very much looking forward to the new set they are sending me, and I know I will get a lot of use out of them."
"So first of all, for anyone just as confused as I was, the speaker of the earbud hangs just below where a daith piercing would be. If that’s all you needed, you’re welcome.

I’ve had these for just over a month now. I’ve always had problems with wireless/bluetooth headphones. When they cover my ears like traditional headphones, I get hot and it gives my head a very unpleasant hair bump. I usually also get a headache after more than an hour because of the added weight. For earbuds, I can never find some that stay in my ears without hurting. If they don’t hurt, they fall out completely. It has been a real struggle.

These sit over the ear and you can adjust so many parts to it, including the ear fitting part. I work in a hospital pharmacy so I use these literally every day and all day. I can play music low and still hear everything around me. Sometimes I forget they are on tbh. I wear glasses and they don’t interfere at all. They are super lightweight. The charging case is super convenient, fits in your pocket without weighing very much at all.

THE EASE OF CONNECTIVITY IS OUTRAGEOUS! (I have iPhone for reference)

In the month I have had them, I’ve never had to reset them. If I disconnect my phone from bluetooth for any reason, I just need to reconnect in my Bluetooth options. Super easy, no messing with the case. I have had so many pairs that make you literally repair them if you so much as charge your earbuds! Also if you want to switch from mono to stereo just open the case, wait for the blue dot, and slip them on/off. I can switch from mono-left ear to mono-right ear in a few seconds without messing with pairing settings at all, just using the case. When I get in my car, I just place the earbuds back into the case and my music continues through my speakers. I can also control the volume through my watch which is super convenient, I didn’t even have to sync that part it just did it.

The battery life is great! Like I said before I play music all day. So if you figure about 7 hours straight of listening time (minus lunch and times I need both ears open) I still have life in them when I get home. You get a soft ding when the battery starts getting low, so no random music drops.

If you need silent moments, just pause. You can hear perfectly fine with them on, like they aren’t even there.

CONS

You /can/ use them on a call but I wouldn’t recommend doing that regularly. I’ve been told it sounds like I’m underwater or across the room.

Sound quality isn’t outstanding but it’s honestly pretty good all things considered. Not Beats obviously, but I’d give sound quality 3.5/5. Remember it’s hovering over your ear, not in your ear, so only so much can be done about that.

You DO need to charge them. I can only get about a day and a half out of them if I use both continuously, so I suggest charging them nightly like your phone.

The touch sensor on the outside of the speaker is super sensitive. I knock it all the time on accident and for me that’s the only annoying thing. But I fiddle with my hair a lot so that’s on me. If you keep your hands away, you’ll be fine.

TLDR; great ear buds for price, and I would buy them again!"
"These open earbuds are my go to for work. They are so comfortable. I forgot I had one on. So far have been durable and battery lasts as advertised. If you are looking for general open ear buds, and want the option of only one ear or both, these will do just fine. If you are looking for heavy base, I don’t think this style is for you. They are designed for the wearer to hear things around them. For that purpose, they perform very well. They are not noise canceling, full music immersion. The size is comfortable and doesn’t interfere with various piercings. Controls are easy to use and good value for the money."
"I recently had the pleasure of trying out the TOZO Open Buds, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed. As an avid music lover and someone who values both audio quality and comfort in earbuds, especially when I’m working out at the gym. The TOZO Open Buds exceeded my expectations in both categories.
Earbud Design (5/5): When you look at the TOZO Open Buds for the first time, you’ll notice that the speakers buds on each side clip around your ear and rest directly next to (but not into) your ear, whereas most competitors still manufacture in-ear earbuds. So at first glance, my concerns would be that the TOZO Open Buds might sound a bit tinny and suffer from both incoming and outgoing noise leakage. TOZO claims to have alleviated this by integrating their ORIGX acoustic technology in conjunction with active noise canceling in order to mute out background noise. After several hours of testing, I was pleasantly surprised at how effective the Open Buds are at very effectively suppressing both incoming and outgoing noise leakage. As a matter of fact, they’re more effecting at suppressing exterior noise than either my in-ear buds or even my over the ear noise-canceling headphones.

Sound Quality (4/5). The sound quality of the TOZO Open Buds is excellent. The open-back design offers a rich, immersive audio experience that brings out the nuances in your music. The clarity and detail in the sound are remarkable, with crisp highs, deep lows, and a balanced mid range. Whether I was listening to my favorite tracks or watching TV, the audio quality was consistently impressive. The mid-range did sound a bit weak but not overly-so. The bass was punchy without being overwhelming, and the vocals were crystal clear. These earbuds are a treat for audiophiles.

Comfort (5/5): Comfort is a top priority for me when it comes to earbuds, and the TOZO Open Buds did not disappoint. They come with a variety of ear tip sizes, ensuring a snug fit for different ear shapes. I was able to wear them for hours on end (including a workout at the Gym) without any discomfort or fatigue. The lightweight design and ergonomic shape make them a joy to wear, whether you're on a long flight or a daily jog. Plus, the open-back design allows for better air circulation, reducing that ""plugged ear"" feeling you get with some closed-back earbuds.

Battery Life (5/5): The TOZO Open Buds offer respectable battery life. On a single charge, I was able to enjoy music for the entire day, which is more than enough for most daily activities. The included charging case provided additional charges, extending the total usage time.

Connectivity (5/5): Pairing the TOZO Open Buds with my devices was extremely easy. They quickly connected to my smartphone and later my tv and after that my gaming console. In each case, they maintained a stable Bluetooth connection throughout my use. I also appreciated the touch controls, which allowed me to play/pause music, adjust the volume, and even answer calls without needing to take my phone out of my pocket.

Build Quality (5/5): These earbuds feel well-constructed and durable. The case has a sleek and compact design that easily fits in my pocket. Furthermore, the addition of another pairing button on the box itself is a welcome addition.

In conclusion, the TOZO keeps managing to one-up itself whenever they create a new product line The Open Buds are a remarkable pair of earbuds that deliver exceptional sound quality and comfort. They also have surprisingly effective noise suppression capabilities. Whether you're a music enthusiast, a podcast lover, a movie lover, or simply need reliable earbuds for daily use, these earbuds are worth considering. I'm thoroughly satisfied with my TOZO Open Buds, and they have displaces some much more expensive ear buds and headphones that I’ve purchased previously as my go-to choice for portable audio."
"In order to go over this product there is one matter that must be addressed. There are in-ear, which go inside your ear and many people do not like how they feel; finding the right ear tip can also be a hassle. Semi-open earbuds (ex. AirPods) don't go inside your ear but they do ""hang on"" to your ear cartilage. After a while you feel the weight and not many people are a fan of earbuds with stems; especially when they touch your skin. The next type, and relevant to this product, is open-ear. They don't do in your ear but their design usually has a hook, the speaker then hovers in front of the ear canal. A new design for open-ear gives them the appearance of an earring, the earbud hangs to the side of the ear cartilage . As a general rule in-ears are better for isolating noise from the environment and provide a relative better sound quality, but comfort can be an issue over long periods of time. Semi-open earbuds are more of a middle ground but many people don't like stems, and they put pressure on your ear. Open-ears allow noise from the environment to come in which means that sound quality is not the same as in-ears and volume might be an issue; like listening to the TV or to your phone using its speakers.

I mention this to point out that open-ears might not be for everyone but they do have their purpose. Before buying them you should decide if they are the style for you and your use case.

My experience with this pair has been good. The volume is enough and I have rarely had to go above 80%, although the average is about 40-60%. This is the second pair of open-ears that I have bought, the first being the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live. Comfort wise the Buds Live put pressure on my ears, similar to semi-open earbuds, unlike the Tozo Open-Ear buds since it has an ear hook the speaker puts no pressure on my ears. The joints on the Tozo earbuds allow them to be adjusted just right, you can place the speaker as close to your ear canal as you want. This helps retain some sound quality, however certain sounds are overemphasized; such as the lower thumps, bass, string instruments and voices. Sound is not the priority as most of the instruments and sound is less prominent, but they are good enough for podcasts and other spoken content; just not for music listening. Because they don't go inside the ear the earbuds stay clean from earwax and oils. The touch sensors are also responsive.

While I liked the Buds Live I bought the Tozo Open-Ear in order to test out this style for myself. It was not for me as sound is a top priority for me. However, during my time using them it was easy to speak to other people while wearing them. Volume was not an issue at home or at a supermarket, but out on the streets the sounds of cars was a bit overwhelming. The app doesn't add too much to the product, still it is easy to find and download through your preferred app store.

I ended up given the pair to my nephew who cannot stand having anything inside his ear and wanted something he could use to watch content on his phone while not disturbing his roommates in college. These are working for him, as intended.

To summarize this review, this style of earbuds are not for me, but that doesn't mean that they are bad. These allow you to remain aware of your surroundings. They are comfortable. The battery lasts a long time (I didn't go over that but I only charged it twice within a month). And they are affordable, I would recommend these as a first pair of open-ears. If you like them, great, if not then at least they didn't cost that much; I got them around $50 while on sale. They are not bad for the price and they have a place in the market."
"I intentionally purchased these headphones to use while running, so my review is based on that. I also really enjoy heavier music, so that is what I have used these headphones for.

I have tried bone conduction, headphones, and for some reason I really don’t enjoy them at all. Perhaps it is the shape of my head, but when running with bone conduction, headphones, I find the sound is very disjointed. I also have found bone conduction headphones aren’t particularly well rounded in the sound department. For that reason, I decided to look for other options, which is when I found these Tozo Openbuds.

Just like bone conduction, headphones, these do not go inside your ear, like traditional earbuds. Unlike bone conduction, these sit on your ear and use 14.2 mm speakers that project directly into the ear. This makes a few major differences. The first is there can actually be substantial bass. The second is even if you have a large head like myself, the bouncing around while running, won’t make the music bounce around because it isn’t reliant on contact with the side of your head like bone conduction. Overall, a better experience.

I do listen to predominantly heavier music, such as metal, metalcore, and some rock music. This is where I had issue with bone conduction, headphones as metal music just doesn’t sound right with them. I understand that with bone conduction the benefit is, you can hear your surroundings which is important while running, but the quality of music dropped significantly for that. These headphones seem to have no issue playing the music I like in an acceptable manner. Instead of being tinny like bone conduction, it was a very full sound, which I appreciate for heavy music. I am not obsessed with bass but it is necessary to have some when listening to heavy music. The mids and treble were also really good rounded out the experience well.

But the sound quality isn’t what sold me on these headphones. I have headphones that sound great, what I didn’t have was headphones that sounded great that I could also run in comfortably. I have a pair of Soundcore Life A2 NCs that I originally bought to run in as some reviews said they were good for that. They are fine, but I found I had to constantly adjust them while running and checked that they weren’t about to fall out. Like most earbuds, for some people they work while running, and some they don’t. The Tozo Openbuds negate that problem by not actually going in your ear, but hooking over your ear and clamping down using the mechanism it has. I did over 3 miles of speed out and not once did I have to adjust these earbuds. They are very light, and also held very strongly in my ears. I could actually focus on running instead of trying to correct their position in my ear.

Open buds as opposed to being in ear, the other benefit of safety is fantastic. I was running with one of my training friends, and I could have a full conversation while also hearing when other people called out when cars were coming while running on the road. I of course didn’t have the volume up incredibly loud, but it was still loud enough for me to enjoy while holding a full conversation.

I haven’t had these headphones long enough to speak on their longevity, but the build construction seems satisfactory. The battery lasted a whole workout, but considering these advertise substantial amount of runtime, I can’t really comment on that from essentially 5 miles of working out.

The touch controls seem to be responsive yet not overly so which I appreciate. Maybe the best way putting it is they are responsive but not overly sensitive. I didn’t use it a lot while running, but it did work quite well. I have use a touch controls while wearing the earbuds around the house and they work really well.

Obviously for earbuds of this size, the case is big. This isn’t an issue for me, but if you wanted a case, that was the size of case, you’ll be disappointed. the case is functional though, and is low profile enough to put in your pocket or in a backpack.

Will also say that the open buds are quite comfortable to wear. I probably could’ve mentioned this earlier, but they are comfortable and light to wear. I haven’t use these for a half marathon for example, but I imagine they will be fine for a distance like that. They are, at least to me, very comfortable, and didn’t hurt my ears. For at least the short distance I wore them for.

I think it goes without saying, but obviously, these are not noise canceling at all. That’s not their purpose, nor is it exactly possible with their design. That is the point though, they’re open so that you can hear the things around you. I know this is an obvious thing to say, but I feel like it should be mentioned at least so people don’t get confused.

I haven’t ran into any issues at all with these earbuds. I’ve had no connectivity issues, no sound issues, and no charging issues. As I have owned them for very long, I cannot say there will be no issues, but I am happy with them so far.

If you want to have a good pair of earbuds for running that aren’t expensive, I would strongly recommend giving these a try. I personally don’t like the idea of spending over $100 on something that might not even work for me, which is why I bought these. I borrowed a pair of Shokz And didn’t like them at all. They were an older model, so I was tempted to buy the newer ones, but I also didn’t want to spend all that money to just not like them. Spending $50 on these Openbuds seems like a more responsible option, and I am happy I bought them. I understand that earbuds in general come down to the individual wearing them, but I feel that the design of these would work for most people.

I obviously have given these five stars. The overall reason I gave The such a high rating is the price was low, the sound quality was high, and I could wear them while running extremely comfortably. I would recommend these to anyone who enjoys running with headphones or working out with headphones. I would also recommend these to anyone who walks to work and wants to be able to hear the world around them."
"I love them almost 5 stars. If there was a half star to add, it would 4.5. I wish the arm that goes behind the ear was longer and/or had locking joints or instead maybe one more adjustable area on the speaker piece that would allow me to move it a few mm out, laterally, away from the ear. I apparently have smaller ears than I even thought. These still hurt my ears to have on for a long time. The speaker piece is just big enough that no matter how I adjust the set it either has to sit on the antihelix or the tragus. And because there is no adjustment, laterally, for the speaker part in relation the ear, it just sits a little too tight and presses down. I have to take turns rotating it along both points of adjustment and moving the whole piece forward and back so the arm sticks further out or closer in so that it isn't sitting in one spot for too long. Now that seems like it's all bad, but it isn't. I can't use in ear headphones for longer than 20 min without pain. These I can get 40 min to an hour before I am adjusting them every way I can so I can use them longer. So I have, by doing all the adjustments, been able to go more than 4 hours before having to switch to the other ear. And yes, I have to have only one piece in at a time so I can give the other ear a break if I know I am going to need them for long time. Otherwise, for short durations, I use both. And let me put this in perspective. I have purchased custom made silicone ear bud pads from an audiologist. Did the mold, sent them off, waited for them to come. They still hurt. Shouldn't have taken them home with only having them in for 5 minutes. I knew better. Now having paid over 200 for them, I can't use them for longer than 20 minutes. So having a head set I can use for hours, even with having to adjust them back and forth, is happiness in sound. As for how they work, I am not audiophile. It is not my hobby or career. I like the sound. Everyone can hear me fine when on the phone. Still learning the button presses. And it sometimes stays connected when I walk into the garage, so through multiple walls and atleast 20 feet away. It does go further than 30 ft sometimes if there is nothing in between it and the phone. So am pleased about that. And love my pink. Love love it."
"Update: these are not supported by the TOZO app so if that's something you require for your earbuds then you might want to look elsewhere. While it would have been nice to have the ability to customize EQs and buttons and touch sensitivity and all that, the inherent risk involved in installing anything on your phone and granting it the permissions required to manage any sort of device is too great for me to really be all that interested in it.

First off I will say that I've only had these for several days but I've used them for multiple hours each of those days with no issues. In that short amount of time they have become my go-to earbuds. I love that I can listen to whatever I want while out walking or hiking and I can still clearly hear my surroundings.

Before purchasing these I was worried that the volume would not be loud enough since they don't actually sit in the ear canal, but so far that has not been an issue. I've worn them while walking my dog near a busy interstate overpass with lots of loud traffic and didn't even have to turn the volume all the way up. The best part is that I can still hear my surroundings just fine!

For those of you concerned about the app, I haven't even downloaded and installed it yet but was still able to pair these with my phone (Pixel 7a running Android 14) and use them with no issues. I have read that the app is not that great so I'm honestly not in a big hurry to try it out, but I will probably do so sooner or later just to check out the options. If I discover anything notable I will report back here.

So far I've only used these earbuds to listen to audiobooks and podcasts so I don't know how music sounds on them yet. I can say that so far the spoken word has sounded clearer and more crisp on these than on my more expensive Anker in-ear earbuds. Still, I'm not expecting audiophile level sound when I do listen to music but maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised.

My only issue with these is that it's kind of a pain to get them to where they feel secure with my glasses on. Neither my glasses nor the earbuds have actually fallen off, but they still feel a little, I dunno, unstable? I really should have thought of that when researching these but it didn't even cross my mind. This isn't something I can blame the manufacturer for at all as I could envision having issues with any earbud with over ear clips like these.

I will also mention that the case and earbuds themselves feel... not the most durable? I have a pair of Anker Soundcore earbuds that came with a case that is, like, solid metal and beefy, lol, and this one is not that. But the build quality is about as expected for the price.

Finally, Even though these earbuds are manufactured in China, the company itself is founded and located in the United States."
"I love the sound quality and the open ear method which is more comfortable for prolonged wear (plus hooks make extra secure from falling vs. in ear buds - though Tozo 10's are great for that too, all great.

The Tozo app (for iPhone, etc.) however, does not offer OpenBuds the same options it does when connecting the Tozo 10 in-ear, and likely others. It is missing ALL of the SETTINGS that are useful for T10's, the same ones that would make it useful for OpenBuds - to me. Quick explaination:

The product photo above shows the app's EQ presets which apply to in-ear, but NOT OpenBuds. That includes various EQ presets for genre like Rock, Jazz, etc., and this full set also includes custom settings for preferred frequencies and savable as custom presets. BUT when you connect OpenBuds to the app, it only shows the following:
1. + 2. Classical & Vocal (the only two genres, NO Pop, Rock, Jazz, Hip-Hope, NONE etc.) so if you like Mozart and Sinatra and that's about it, you're all set.
3. + 4. Bass Boost & a Treble Boost, which are not adjustable; hi or lo end goes WAY up or not at all. This is not for fine tuning a sound, it's for fixing a problem with a bad master or player - but even still, no adjustment options means it's most likely to over-compensate, and you'll get Too Little bass/treble or Too Much. Not useful.
5. Standard - this just resets the sound back to no EQ at all. So it's not a setting at all, just a defeat button.
Bear in mind, in no way can you adjust and frequencies on your own, whereas with reg earbuds, you can & more. So if you'd like to say boost all the frequencies to get louder output overall for a song with low level, No Can Do. For popular music styles, you have 4 mostly worthless choices.

I wrote Tozo about this problem, sent a pic of the OpenBud options, along with a product pic of the full options as shown on this Amazon listing - where it shows the full set I have seen with reg earbuds. The response was quick but not helpful and I'm not sure they understand the problem. They said the OpenBuds off are described as having 5 presets so what is showing in my app must be correct. They did not comment on the product shot I included showing the app next to product with full set of EQ options, nor did they address the suggestion that having Classical & Vocal the only genres, and Bass / Treble boost the only other options, makes no sense at all and useless for most listeners.

Hopefully they'll catch this oversight and get the full EQ options for OpenBuds. It's an upgrade premium product, it makes no sense not to use the more useful EQ settings - at very least they could allow custom changes & saves only, which could cover any use you have if you trust your ears. But no. So hopefully they'll catch up to this and fix it."
"As someone who is basically listening to something 24/7, I recently discovered the great benefits of open ear headphones. Namely, that they make it so I no longer have choose between hearing the outside world and hearing my music/podcast/audio book, or compromise by having only 1 ear bud in.

As a Tozo fan, I originally purchased their Open Ego's which served my needs better than all my previous in-ear earbuds. However they had the downside of just not being as ""secure"" as I'd ideally want. If I bent over they would sometimes fall off. This was also an issue with any in-ear headphones, so I'd just accepted that the OE's were my best option.

When I saw Tozo released their O2 and reviews saying they solved this problem though, I just had to pick up a pair. And I can definitely say: They solved it!

These have all the great features of the original Open Ego's and are also most secure headphones I've ever worn. I could be running, jumping, doing backflips, whatever—anything short of sky diving I don't think these are ever coming off without your choosing. I also really like that the earbuds turn, so they are easy to take on and off without messing up your settings.

All in all, I am super happy with my purchase and would recommend these to anyone who is looked for an open ear headphone that is extremely secure."
"Embracing the age of Amazon, I have tested 9 different open-ear headphones this past week. I own Sennheiser in-ear earbuds which set the bar for quality sound high. I accept that open-ear cannot sound as good as in-ear but I can’t rationalize spending money on something that doesn’t sound good to listen to even if it’s more comfortable. I bought the in-ear buds for the best sound and a close second in comfort so I was looking to flip that for open-ear, comfort first with sound a close second.

Every other pair I tried this week failed in one of the two categories, usually sound. They are all $100 or less. I did NOT try the Shokz but the very mixed reviews (taken with grains of salt) left me thinking that even if they were better, they wouldn’t be worth spending twice as much.

The TOZO Open Buds sound so full and clear I had to immediately compare them to my Sennheiser. In-ear won simply because the seal creates more bass depth but these buds sound better than a lot of in-ear buds I tested when originally shopping for the Sennheisers. This is due to the ability to adjust the fit of these earbuds in multiple planes so that the speaker is sitting close to and aimed into the ear canal while still being genuinely open-ear in design. I tried every type of music I listen to, low volume retains excellent clarity and they turn up louder (and still undistorted) than I would ever listen to anything (including at the gym). I had 2 other brands I tried with these today and I put the other ones on again to make sure I was not just “preferring“ the last pair I tried and they were even better after retrying the other 2.

I’m not an audiophile but I’m picky about how I want my music to sound. I was hoping I would find a pair of open-ear earbuds that were close enough in sound quality to make them worth wearing over the in-ear sometimes. After the first 8 I tried, I was ready to accept that comfort would have to be the only thing that mattered. These blow the rest away in both categories and I promise you, the sound is better than a lot of in-ear buds.

I also saw the 14.2 vs 16.2mm driver size and figured that bigger should be better. These are 14.2 which told me that that number does not deliver the kind of results you think it should, at least not right now.

You cannot go wrong with these. They fit perfectly, they are extremely comfortable, and they sound better than you thought this style could sound. You can keep shopping around if you like the search but when you are ready to settle on a pair and IF sound quality still matters to you, just get these and be as amazed as I still am."
"Based on the reviews, I chose the Tozo 02 and really hoped they would deliver. Well, deliver they did. I do a lot of road cycling so today I used them for the first time on a 3.5 hr ride. Goodness, I was blown away by the quality and the sound. For the price point I can't believe how good they are. The controls take a bit of acclimating but once you get used to them, it's fine. Of course wind noise affects the sound but the most important thing is I heard everything around me which is most important. At no time did the earbuds distract me so 100% thumbs up. If you want studio sound then spend $200 but for what they are, I highly recommend them. Charging is fast, fit is good and they did not move off my ears even when descending at 35+ mph. No discomfort was experienced so I'm very pleased with my purchase."
"Easy to use, easy to pair(no having to guess about which mystery name these have had assigned to them), they last forever on each charge, and they don't make my ears hurt after wearing them. The best thing I can say is that they are so comfortable I had one on, turned it off to do something, and forgot I had it on for several *hours*. Not listening to anything, but so unobtrusive that I literally forgot I was wearing it. That's a solid win, in my book. I highly recommend these. For us regular people who do regular active things, who need to be able to bend and move and who like to listen to something of our own choice, these are great. No ear fatigue, and even with sunglasses they are still comfortable. Good sound, and the adjustable angle is marvelous. The touch control for on/off is very sensitive, but not so much that it's aggravating. These have been my best- ever ""take a chance on something new"" purchase."
"For a while now, all of the headphones and earbuds that I've been able to find pretty much anywhere are all in-ear noise cancellation. Such headphones have literally never fit properly for me, required constant adjustment not to fall out, and completely blocked out the outside world, meaning I couldn't use them for work where I'm required to talk to co-workers and customers.

These headphones solve all of those issues. They are light and comfortable, and I can even comfortable wear them while laying on my side in bed. They have never even felt loose, even when moving around and exercising, allowing me to listen to music or take calls without any worries.

The batteries last for a surprisingly long time. I know they advertise 12 hours of use time before needing to charge, but I didn't think they were serious. I've used these for upwards of 6-7 hours of constant use without any issues at all.

I will mention that the microphone, according to those I've spoken with, sounds a little low quality, but not terrible. It's definitely good enough for taking occasional calls, and I don't see it as a deal breaker.

I've also not seen anyone post a picture of what the inside of the earpieces look like, so I'm including some myself.

Overall, very high quality, very comfortable, very lightweight. I could see myself forgetting they're there with enough time. I'm very happy with my purchase."
"I have a daith piercing in my right ear that gets really sore and also causes a poor fit with in-ear earbuds. For over a year, I’ve only been able to wear an AirPod in my left ear and was wishing I could listen to things with my right ear again. Enter these open Tozo earphones. These turned out to be much better than what I was expecting and are now my favorite pair of earphones ever. I was even able to use an Amazon coupon to save some money, so I got plenty of value from these for what I paid.

Pairing them was super easy out of the box, and they’ve stayed effortlessly paired to my iPhone since. I actually think they’re more responsive than my AirPods, which don’t always connect when they should. The second I take these Tozo buds out of the charging case, they’re already connected and ready to stream.

I can comfortably wear them on both ears, including the one with the sore daith piercing. A bonus is that they allow me to hear my surroundings, so I can avoid accidentally tuning out my toddler or any potential hazards while wearing them outside. I primarily use these for listening to audiobooks while doing chores, walking in the park, or nap trapped, etc. and typically wear only one side at a time. I find they are excellent like this and have listened for many hours at a time without the batteries dying on me. I keep the case charged and will rotate which bud I use from time to time so that they can stay charged and ready. Both buds at once or just one at a time offer great sound and clarity for both audiobooks and music. Soft/low tones in music or audiobooks/podcasts with spoken words can get lost if you are surrounded by a lot of noise. Sometimes I have to increase the volume or rewind to make out what was said in these cases, if the environment is too loud. That said, no one around me has mentioned that they can hear MY media at a noticeable or inconvenient level. As I said, I use them while lying with my napping toddler and they haven’t disturbed him yet.

I also tried exercising with them today (I ran on a treadmill and jumped on a trampoline) and they didn’t budge. They’re very customizable/adjustable for the perfect, comfortable, secure fit, and as someone else mentioned, they have a bit of a ratcheting action where you can cinch them down on your ears so that they hold tight and won’t fall off. I have never had any issues with the fit or comfort unless wearing them for hours and hours which may cause some expected soreness due to pressure.

I don’t use the press/touch feature much as I typically have my phone in hand, but it seems responsive enough. Tbh, I have always struggled with this kind of mechanic and haven’t mastered all of the commands, but play/pause is simple enough and the only command I’ll probably ever try to use anyway. I will say that if I really cared to learn, compared to my AirPods, these are much easier as the touch zone is much larger and clearly identified.

In conclusion, these are quite brilliant little earphones and I’m grateful to have found them. They are definitely a quality of life upgrade in my day to day life."
"update:
The replacement pair worked well for a bit longer, a total of about 4 hours where I wore them about 60 minutes at a time while exercising. This morning, 35 minutes into my walk, the right earbud started doing the same things - cutting in and out (mostly out), and making popping noises. This time, the left earbud also cut out a couple of times, but mostly stayed working.
Here's where it gets interesting. I remember reading a review where someone else was saying that if they put the buds back in the case, then use them again, they were fine. Well, the music podcast episode I was listening to ended, and then my podcast app (pocketcasts) started playing the next episode automatically. Lo and behold, the right earbud was fully functional again! There must have been a reset in the bluetooth connectivity or something, upon loading the new episode, that reset the connectivity.
When my first pair failed, I was listening to a playlist in Youtube music. Apparently when it switched from song to song, that was not enough to reset the bluetooth like it was in Pocketcasts.
So. I am going to try reaching out to support for Tozo and see if they have any thoughts or suggestions, since I still really love these earbuds. I'll continue to update the review as I get new info!

original review:
I LOVE the fact that these earbuds are open ear, so that I can wear them for a run without getting that fish bowl feeling that sealed-ear earbuds give. AND the fact that I can adjust these so that they are at the correct angle for my ears is AMAZING. I can't believe how good they sounded. Until they didn't :(
I was near the end of my 10k run this morning, when the right earbud started cutting in and out (mostly out), and was also making crackling/popping noises. I've initiated a return and should have a new pair soon, and I REALLY hope they last because oh my god, these are the perfect earbuds for me for running.
I've tried a few other brands of open ear buds - some very expensive, some more around this price point. The problem with all of them is that the earbud part never seems to sit at the right place for my ear, causing the sound to be very thin no matter what I do. With these TOZO buds, I can point the earbud right into my ear canal and get great sound while still hearing the outdoor sounds around me at the same time.
I'll update this review when I get the replacement pair."
"This is my first pair of open air ear buds. I read about them in June and started searching for the right pair. I wanted to keep cost low, but still get good features like being water proof. After several reviews from other people and techie sites, I found these. They are super comfortable. The way the ear hook moves independently of the speaker makes sure you can get a good angle for comfort no matter how your ear is shaped. They are definitely water proof. I showered with them and washed my hair. When I took them off, I had to dry them, and some water did come from the hinge where the ear hook meets the speaker bud, but they dried nicely and still work. Sometimes I like to listen to ambient sounds when I sleep, but I don't want to keep my husband awake by playing the sound to the room, headphones are way too bulky, and earbuds can hurt after a while. These are completely comfortable to sleep in, even on my side.
On an even more personal note, I have Psoriasis inside my ears, so wearing earbuds does not work, as it causes pain and other issues. I also have my ears pierced in several places, so bulky headphones really can push my earrings into my head and hurt a lot. Open air ear buds has solved both of these problems simply by their design. So, even if you choose a different brand, the technology itself is too useful to pass up! Forget your Beats by Dre, air pods or whatever."
"I have a job where I get to listen to music for 10 hours a night, every night and these are what I use. I have been using Tozo solely for almost two years now because the value for the money is amazing. They are durable, last a long time, sound great, and probably the best value you will find for any earbud/earphones. The battery is also fantastic. I can easily go 3+ days before needing to charge.

I accidentally washed these one day and didn't realize it until I heard them thumbing around in the dryer. After I took them out and let them dry for a couple of days they still worked as if they were still new.

I have bought two pairs of these, two pairs of OpenEgo, headphones, and some earbuds (the ones not pictured are in my locker at work) because I want to support the brand since they keep bringing earphones to the market that other companies would charge $150+ for."
"I have owned these for a year and used them every other day while running. The sound quality/clarity is shockingly good (especially the bass response). I also own a pair of AirPod Pros and use them in transparency mode while running. There are a few very important reasons I prefer the TOZOs to the AirPod Pros for running. 1. The TOZOs never slide out or need to be pushed back on, they just hang comfortably/securely. and 2. They enable natural situational awareness (i.e. proper directional cues) versus the AirPods which tend to have odd cutoffs in specific sound reproduction that make it difficult to discern where a sound is coming from (this is essential for running at night on streets to tell where a car is coming from).

Sadly after a year of constant use, one of my earbuds batteries died completely and would not charge. I contacted TOZO and after a few exchanges to troubleshoot they generously offered to replace the product. What a pleasure to see a company stand by their product so thoroughly!

I recommend these strongly to anyone who enjoys music/content but wants to still maintain situational awareness, they are an awesome product made by a great company!"
"Update: I originally knocked off a star for range but my Bluetooth in the laptop seems to be going bad and I have to think that was the issue rather than the earbuds themselves. I bought a usb Bluetooth with logn range and I can listen to these anywhere in the house now and even out in the yard, while my older regular earbuds get a bit less range.
----
It connects soon as I pick them up from the charger.

They do sound great and are very loud. I have some tozo earbuds from years ago that are still going strong so I expect them to last and these do sound better than those.

They only last 8 hours of mostly constant play, other earbuds I've had last around 10 but it's still a good length of time.

The adjustability is great and they are very comfortable but they could be better, if they had rounded edges. The pointed corner hurts if I turn it into my ear cup so I have to leave it out a bit. But that aside they are very light and comfortable and don't fall off, even with glasses and my long hair getting tucked behind my ear. I can forget that they are on if nothing is playing.

One other thing is there's no charge indicator. Most buds have a light that is on while charging and goes out when off. This has no light to indicate bud charge. I assume the app might tell you but the app doesn't work on PC, it's for phones only. So the only way to know is pick it up and check in the pc's blue tooth settings what % charge it is reading. Don't know why they thought getting rid of the charge indicator was a good idea.

I had bonebuds before, which are similar and sounded good as well but the battery in the main earbud(I use one at a time) I use died after just a year and they are heavier. The bone buds had great range I could get near halfway down the street to the mail box before loosing connection and it picked right up once back in range.

I decided to try the BOLOXA s12 first, as a replacement, but returned them because they kept popping off my ears and didn't sound good. So love the adjustable design of these.

So pros:
sounds great, lots of base
Very comfortable and adjustable
don't fall off.

Cons:
No charging indicator.
Lack of range and trouble fully reconnecting when coming back in range. (range is now fine with the new Bluetooth)"
"First let me say that I’m extremely picky about my headphones. So picky in fact that for the last 10 years I’ve been purchasing old wired Phillips over the ear headphones via eBay for 5x the original price since they’ve been discontinued for years now. I’m happy to say that I’ve finally found a comparable (and wireless) replacement for by beloved over the years ear headphones!! (Also - why aren’t more companies selling over the ear options!? )

The sound quality is excellent and they are as comfortable as the headphones can be. I have very small ears and earbuds are simply out of the question. For these, I can wear them for 2-3 hours without a problem. After a few hours they do start to feel heavy on the top of the ears and a bit uncomfortable, but that’s probably a good thing since it reminds me that it’s time to take a break anyway.

For some reason Amazon is flagging these with a warning of high return when you put them in your cart. I almost didn’t purchase them because of it. So glad I ignored that warning. If anything, I’ll be buying 2-3 more just in case they end up discontinuing these :)"
"Got these to replace my Apple Earpods that started giving me ear pain.

So far these appear to be working.

What I like;
Paired with multiple devices. Mac Book, iPhone & Samsung.

What I don't like
1. Kinda awkward trying to fit the hook over my ear. Feels like it might snap off. Not confident in its limited flexibility.

2. Slightest touch whilst attaching over my ear, mutes or triggers the audio players on my phone or laptop. Quite quite annoying.

Will see how they hold up.

Update August
I'm in a lot of meetings via Microsoft Teams. I prefer to use one earphone at a time so both don't die at the same time.

At first audio was okay but my team started telling my my audio is very choppy. Geeze.
I'm then forced to turn off noise canceling & wear both at the same time.

Dunno...maybe they don't work well with Microsoft Teams.

Never had those issues with my Apple earpods sooo it has to be technology quality of the Tozos. I really need noise canceling but don't think these are 100% up for the challenge.

However, if using just to listen to music...they are okay.

Also, wish the over the ear hook was thinner & more flexible. It's kinda bulky as I wear glasses. I have to remove them to put these on. A thinner, more flexible yet sturdy earhook that allows for an easy slide over & around the ear would be great."
I totally love these Open Ear Headphones. They are so light weight I can wear them for hours and forget they are on my ears. I don't handle earbuds very well at all so these are perfect. ALSO the DUAL BLUETOOTH IS A GAME CHANGER!! Never again will I buy a headphone without being Dual Bluetooth. The ease of pairing with any devise is so easy and the fact I could be listening to something on my iPad and then receive a phone call on my iPhone and not have to mess with turning bluetooth off and connecting or taking them off is simply Awesome. And the price is right! Buy them you won't be sorry!!!!!
"Paid about the same for these as the pair of in-ear Jabras I have, which came highly recommended - but there is no comparison between the two. These are way more comfortable (and sanitary, as they sit outside the ear canal); the sound is crisper and clearer - and they last waayyy longer than the Jabras before needing a charge. Bonus - because they sit outside the ear canal, you can also still hear what's going on around you - safer and much better if you're using them while working. I like these so much, I'm considering buying a second pair!"
"Pro: Comfortable on the ear, light and not too tight. I really like the angle adjustment, it helps to put the speaker section in the optimal place. They haven't fell out of my ears yet, which is unusual for me. Very good signal rang; I often leave phone on a table while I putter around the house, and don't have problems with dropped signal.
Adequate: Good tone range
Con: Battery life isn't as good as other earbuds I have used, maybe 4 hours or so. They seem to recharge in a reasonable time, though. The charging case has only a blinking light to indicate charging status, which was standard on my past earbuds over the past few years. There is a slightly muffled or duledl quality to the sound, it's not as crisp as an in-ear earbuds.
I generally use them to listen to audio books and podcasts. I don't think I would use them to listen to music, though."
"First of all, I rabidly HATE traditional earbuds and I've tried several.

I think maybe my ear canals are smaller than normal so I can never get earbuds to fit properly. They are always falling out and are NEVER comfortable. I also have a tendency to get itchy eczema in my ear canals and, by trapping moisture in, earbuds only exacerbate this. Thus, I had for the past several years resigned myself to big, clunky over-the ear headsets.

A good pair of these solved all but two issues: they look funny on me (or so I have been told on Zoom calls) and they are not at all convenient for travel, especially when I'm trying to get 10 days of stuff into a single carry-on bag. My headphones and case take up as much space as an entire summer outfit! So... I gave the TOZO O2 True Open Ear Wireless Headphones a shot and there's no going back!

They don't trap moisture inside my ears, they don't fall out (I've even slept with them on and they were still attached in the morning), they are super-comfortable and they can go anywhere I go. I love my TOZOs!"
"I took a chance and ordered the TOZO OpenBuds Lightweight True Open Ear Wireless Earbuds as a set of buds to use working around the house. I figured they would sound cheap and weak, but that was not the case. They sound great!! Good sound separation and decent bass. I thought, ""These actually sound great, but I bet the Bose Ultra Open EarBuds would blow them out of the water."" So to test my theory, I bought a set, and I must say that I was sooo disappointed in the sound! The overall sound was good (as usual), but the level was far less than the TOZOs (impressive). Bass response was less than the TOZOs as well. So back went the Bose Open Earbuds to Best Buy. I decided to pick up a set of Shokz OpenFit Air True Wireless Earbuds to see how they compare. They were about the same as the Bose Earbuds. The TOZOs win again!! I'm not quite through testing the Shokz, but I think they'll be going back shortly.

Sound is subjective I know, and what you listen is as well. But as far as MY ears go the TOZOs are the winner. I will be wearing them inside and out for the foreseeable future, and I like them enough to order and send a pair to my brother. I'm waiting for his feedback. Happy listening!!"
"I am not a fan of ear buds it mostly cause I am sure I have small ear canals like my mom so these are a savior!
The sounds quality is awesome and I love how they can adjust to your ear so they are snug and do fall off but don't pinch either.
Plus the price is great I have used more expensive ones and I can say I like these alot more.
Even my fiancee wants a pair now so I will definitely be buying another pair soon!"
"I just got these and so far they are very nice. They are very light weight! The sound is good so far. I’ve only made 1 call and that person could hear me well! That’s 1 of the 2 reason I tried these. 1 I needed something that worked well with calls and 2 I liked that these don’t go in my ear so my ears won’t get sore. Bonus these are adjustable!! These so far are GREAT! As of right now I TOTALLY recommend these!!
Update… I still really like these. 2 things I would change… 1 you do sound like your far away or in a tunnel sort of speak but you can hear the person on the other end of the line and they can hear you. 2 I wish these would connect to 2 devices at a time. My JBLs could connect to my iPad and my iPhone at the same time. It was really convenient!"
"I purchased these kind of on a whim, after seeing these on sale, and I think they frequently are on sale, and for ~50 USD you cannot go wrong with the Tozo Openbuds if this is the type of headphone you are shopping for. Excellent sound quality, can easily enjoy a variety of genres without having to adjust the headphone settings or EQ them, fairly comfortable, and no connection issues + multipoint connection.

I have already purchased Shokz bone conduction headphones (The Open Run Pro), and I really like my Shokz headphones, and those are more comfortable, and do not block the ear canal at all, so that is a positive compared to these headphones, but honestly you cannot enjoy music on the Shokz, those are just for listening to podcasts and audiobooks, or meetings. The Tozos can be used for any audio application at a fraction of the cost, which is great!

I am very impressed with the detail and sound quality produced from the headphones, which may be because they are fundamentally putting a small speaker near your ear, like a traditional headphone, just without the cup. You aren't getting the same level of quality compared to a traditional headphone or similar priced IEM, but that's not why you are buying these, you want to be able to hear all around you! And in that context these are smashing the competition, and I think they actually bleed less sound than the Shokz do as well. Additionally you can adjust the angle and height on the ear easily so it will be positioned perfectly.

These also handle multipoint playing better than any other headphone I have used, it will switch intelligently between the sources very efficiently. I think this has reduced my battery life a bit, but I still get 4-8 hours on a charge.

I have 2 negatives, overall, which are quite minimal. The case does not display the charge level, which is annoying, but you can work around. The other is the comfort over hours, it holds onto/pinches and rubs the top of my ear just enough to irritate it, which is not too bad, but definitely makes me feel them at times.

This honestly feels like a rare product where you are getting so much more than the asking price, it is a little shocking. I cannot recommend this enough if this is the type of headphone you are in the market for. It is criminally under reviewed for the quality."
"They aren’t noise cancelling, so if that’s something important to you, I wouldn’t get them. I almost returned them, but missed the return by date. I was pleasantly surprised by these though. I’d forgotten my other ear buds, and found these in my glove compartment. They were plenty loud enough for me to hear when I was in a loud trampoline park. I could hear very well even though I could also hear my surroundings. I also love that they are very adjustable. Definitely worth it! Glad I missed my return window."
"I usually don't do reviews, but I'm very happy and impressed by these open ear phones, I tested them out all day, the sound quality to me is OK, but the comfort of these make up for that. I wear classes and my head phones would hurt my ears, I bought ear buds and that did the same, but these feel just right, I even went to sleep in these and had no problem."
"Hubby's motorcycle doesn't have a radio so he wears headphones, typically only 1 so he can hear and still pay attention to the road, the ear buds he had before had great sound quality but when he put his helmet on they would always fall out and just be a pain to fix(iykyk).

He mentioned wanting to try some that had over the ear hooks to maybe avoid the ear buds falling out when he put his helmet on, so I found these Gems 💎 and poof, helmet/earbud issue solved! And he can still hear the road!
Sound quality is great for what we need them for, totally adjustable for your ear size/shape. All while still being able to listen to your surroundings. Great buy! We chose the black color, so far we have had no issues with charging and battery life.
Husband has informed me that when he's going 70 on the highway with Vol. All the way up the music is a bit hard to hear. Note: he has a loud motorcycle and his helmet doesn't keep the wind noise out, so inside his helmet is very loud.
The buttons are a bit different than your normal BT headphones.
One side controls Vol. Up and change forward song, the other side is Vol. Down and back a song. But it's nothing you can't adjust to. Over all, a great buy! No real complaints so far! Will update if we notice anything!"
I LOVE these headphones. Im not a fan of the buds you stick in your ear. They get uncomfortable fast for me.. or noise cancelling when nothing is playing. I much prefer the over the head headphones but those are so big and bulky to wear constantly. I was looking for something sleek to wear on the day to day around the house or for work. I have kids and want to be able to hear them without constantly taking them out and back in when they ask me something. (Which is every 2 minutes or so) I don't even notice these are on. And when I do have something playing they sit on my ear comfortably and have great clear sound. Not muffled by any means and outside noise doesn't affect how it sounds. I LOVE these. I will never get earbuds again.
"I actually needed to buy bluetooth headphones because I fried the headphone jack on my phone (kayaking, accidental submerge ). It worked out though as the openbuds were a terrific buy. The sound quality is excellent, but the fit and open air design is the standout. I hate traditional earbuds, they never fit in my ears well, and become really uncomfortable. The openbuds rest against the ear, so you barely feel them , and I feel safer that I can hear my environment around me when needed. I also had an issue with one of the pairs I bought, and customer service resolved it with no hassle. Highly recommend."
"These are the best headphones I've gotten in probably 10 years. Sound quality is on par with ones double the price, hardware looks and feels sturdy. But the best part is the unique design, you get a lot of range of motion and can customize where you want it to fall on each ear individually. One of my ears is a little different than the other and I have sensitive ears from an injury, so in ear headphones have always been a struggle. Good sounding over the ear headphones get bulky. Other open ear headphones I've tried still go in the ear too far or never quite fit on one of my ears. Highly recommend."
"These buds are awesome! The fit and sound (especially with the companion equalizer app) are a top pick.
I use these primarily while running - they always stay put.
By being adjustable you get a 'custom fit' - right where you want them- they have never fallen our or become misaligned over the many miles that I've run. In-ear buds were never satisfying to me - my ears would hurt after extended wear and were prone to falling out.
The sound is wonderful as is the battery life. The companion equalizer app lets you shape the music to your liking - it includes several pre-set tones.
I don't worry about others hearing them since I'm usually running alone with them. That said, I wore them on several flights and no one else could hear them - I asked around.
I had a need to contact their customer service. They readily and promptly resolved the issue with great communication and timely responses.
Buy these!"
"These headphones are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn! I can wear them for a full work shift of 8 hours straight wearing my glasses, and my hairband at times, never having my ears hurt. My last pair would hurt the back of my ears after 2 hrs with just my glasses on. They sound great no matter where I put the ear piece, making them perform perfectly. I can hear and have conversations with people with the music still on low. Charging is a breeze as you charge the case and when you put the earbuds back in they charge while in the case. So easy to use, mic is easy to hear on the other end as well even covered with all my long curly hair. 🤣😂 So I'd say these are no doubt the best value and best purchase I'd ever made for ear buds! As for durability I can't say anything about that as I haven't had them very long. Will update after having them for a month or two."
"I have a few Open ear solutions from (After)Shokz Open Run and Open Run Pros, to OWS 2 AND OLADANCE OWS PRO? The weird cleft note shaped open ears, and now these.

Pros:
-Fit; I mean it's near impossible for these to not fit your ears. If you have ears, these will fit. They're super flexible and easy to manipulate into the best position for you.
-Sound: These sound like $75 ANKER IN-EARS, that is to say they sound REALLY GOOD, decently full audio, maybe a little bass sacrificed but they're definitely above $50 headphones and below $100.

Cons:
-This is conflicting; Volume. These get nice and loud which kind of makes them my new go-to for IN-HOME Chores since this will easily power through the noisiest of vacuums. But then they block out too much of the world sound at those volumes where it kind of defeats the function of open ears.
-Sound Quality Sustain. This goes with the volume issue, the best sound quality is at FULL volume. BUT due to how these sit ON AND OVER your ears, means that if you go quieter than max sound quality gets quite flat. Where other buds in this category, are more focused on DIRECTING SOUND. Like both Oladance products hug the ear cup to varying success kind of letting sound ooze into the ear using the curvature of the ear. Shokz says ""Who Cares about the outer ear, we're going inner ear"". This (TOZO) says; ""We'll speak directly into it."" It's literally like holding two tiny bluetooth speakers a centimeter above each hole. Now don't get me wrong, even at OPEN EAR levels, which is to say about 25% quieter than this max, it still sounds within range, quality wise, of their WAY MORE EXPENSIVE competitors save for maybe the Open Run Pros.

Comparison:
Aeropex (now just Open Run) $150
Open Run Pro $180
Oladance OWS 1 $150
Oladance OWS Pro $230
Tozo $45 (with $10 off coupon)

So there's the prices. Now ranking them, I might put the Run Pros ahead of TOZO as an OPEN EAR, and sound quality they're on par. Might give TOZO the edge on sound quality, but then it ceases to be an open ear. Then I'd go OWS 1, OWS Pro, Aeropex. SO, TOZO easily beats out the OWS Pros which are like... over 4x the price (without sale or coupon) and HANDILY BEATS THEM in every metric, sound quality, comfort, case size, etc. They're going toe to toe with the best Shokz bone conduction has to offer and that costs over 3x as much as these.

Conclusion:
The point is, for the price, in this category, these things are kicking the butts of devices that cost 3-5x as much as them. DHRME I want to say was the YouTube Channel that turned me onto this option, and at this price, was not a huge financial risk. Glad I took the chance, missed out on the Cyber Monday deal which I think put them at like $35, but $45 was still good enough, especially since you're getting better than ""GOOD ENOUGH"". HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM. Since you can use them in open ear mode, or you can crank up the volume, get the fuller sound experience and do some vacuuming, studying and what not that you don't need to worry about situational awareness. Compared to its peers, this is beating most of them at literally a fraction of the price. Do I recommend them? YES, DEFINITELY. They're great, you're not going to find a better fit out there."
"I've never had open ear wireless headphones and I'm very happy with these. I had been using wired Etymotic earphones and after a while they we uncomfortable inside my ears. These just rest outside of my ears and I hardly notice they're there. They were cheap enough, $45.00 and I was very surprised at the bass response and the fidelity in general. I can't wear them in noisy places, but around the house they're just fine. I can't wear most ear buds. They'll fall out of my ears so these hook on to the tops of my ears and swivel and are perfect. I'll buy another pair when these wear out."
"The Tozo Openbuds are comfortable. You can have them in your ears for hours and you won't feel any discomfort. Its speaker can be rotated in two axes, so you can adjust it for greater ergonomics as well as to be able to listen better, whether you want to listen to the audio with more power or you want to achieve a better balance between its sound and the ambient sound.
Its digital touch is correct but when you want to increase or decrease the volume by tapping a little longer, sometimes it performs another action. The battery lasts about 4 hours but every time you put them in their box, it charges them again. I do consider that this box lacks a more efficient way to monitor and report the status of the battery.
I'm a runner and cyclist, and I sweat a lot. I have damaged several headphones with IPX7 water protection. These Tozo Openbuds do not have as high a degree of resistance but, since they are held in the ear, they receive less liquid. I hope they don't get damaged.
Finally, they have excellent sound. Through its App you can equalize it. Of course, since they are not placed in the ear canal, ambient sound can overwhelm the sound of the Openbuds. However, it is very safe to be able to hear your surroundings.
I recommend the Tozo Openbuds, both for their excellent features and ergonomic design as well as for the excellent service of the Customer Service Department of the Tozo brand."
So these were perfect for what I was needing! Open air so I can hear what's around me while walking or jogging at night while delivering crisp clear sound! Tozo does it again! I own many of their earbuds and bluetooth speakers and every product has been of exceptional quality and performance. Their products are really well made. Solid build that feels good in the hands. Their prices are also excellent - so just a knock out company all around!
"I really loved the sound from these! Genuinely impressed and surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Ultimately I decided to return them as the ear loops were just a little too stiff for my personal preference on one of my ears - admittedly I'm rather sensitive so this was completely a me issue and not a fault in the product. I eventually purchased a popular brand which is 3x as expensive but fit my ear a little better. Honestly, the TOZO sound is just as good, perhaps even better!"
"I got these, set them up easily after a good charging session, and had the on all day with any pain. I even forgot I had them on until I’d hear a text notification, lol. I’m super happy, because every other type of earbuds hurt. These open earbuds don’t fall off, don’t hurt, and they don’t bother my glasses, which I have to wear all the time. I was worried that my glasses would make them fall off or be uncomfortable, but that’s not the case. Having them on so much means I have to charge my phone more often, but I keep a power bank with me, so it’s not a problem. I also want to mention the sound quality: it’s great. I like being able to hear my surroundings when I’m out or waiting at the doctor’s office, or for my name to be called at my fave coffee shops. They’re a great price, I think they are awesome, and I definitely recommend them. I sat on the fence, because I didn’t want another set I couldn’t use, but I’m glad I tried them. Happy customer!"
"Not only does the sounds quality highly exceed my expectations, the earbuds also include a 18 month warranty through TOZO. I am highly impressed. Will definitely be looking into their other products. Also, functionality is great with their app which allows for EQ customization and custom profiles from other uses in the community. Will update on battery life and charging speed after testing for a bit longer. Overall 9/10 so far!"
I cannot wear traditional earbuds for any amount of time as they just hurt my ears. I decided to give these a try and I so glad I did! The sound is amazing and they are so comfortable it’s easy to forget you are wearing them. Connecting them to my iPhone was a breeze. Highly recommend!!!
These are really good for the price. I like that they don't go inside you ear so you can still hear what's going on around you. Really easy to operate with and easy to pair with your phone too. I think the only thing I saw people didn't like about these is that they are small but I am also not a big guy so they work great for me.
I use earbuds on a daily basis for long hours and was noticing my ears were bothering me from having them in so much. I decided to give these a try as I needed something that was outside of the ear but not necessarily noise canceling and could listen with one ear only. The sound is so much better than I expected and they are super comfortable.
The absolute best headphones I have ever worn. The sound is awesome and most importantly they don't hurt my ears like every other pair. Being able to hear everything around you and still have a normal conversation while listening to something is a game changer. Firmware updates and EQ options.... I wish I discovered this type of buds years ago. Customer service answered my question right away. The only improvement could be the case - feels a bit cheap and uses white and orange light to indicate charge percentage. White is fully charged - slow blinking orange seems to be <75 and fast blinking orange <25. Case could be improved but still the ultimate headphones.
I love the way it snaps into place on my ear. I love the sound quality. I do not like that it doesn't have an actual button to turn on and off or answer calls. I also don't like that it doesn't show how much it's charged or charging in the case. Overall it's a really good set for the price.
"I bought these for my hubby to take to the gym. He loves them. He says they work very well and loves that you can just give them a quick tap and then be able to hear outside noise, like when people are talking to you. He has been using them almost everyday for two months and has had no issues with them. Charging is easy and I feel they are well worth the cost, which was a good value for this product. We're hoping they last a lot longer than his previous ear buds."
Great pair that’s very comfortable to wear. Unfortunately the volume somehow would not go higher despite trying all the solutions that Tozo recommended. In the end they offered to send me a replacement (I only paid tax) and so far it’s working well. Great customer service keeps me coming back.
"The open ear concept has been a godsend to me as over/on ear sets are so bulky and become uncomfortable after awhile and in-ear earbuds are just plain uncomfortable.

I've tried 5 different products that are open ear, including this one, and this one is, by far, the best and incidentally the best value.

Two of the things that are most important to me when it comes to open ear style is 1: Loudness and 2: Comfort.

I understand that open ear has inherent weaknesses like sound quality, bass, and noise cancellation and no open ear set will ever really match the level of the aforementioned traits of in-ear/over ear. One would just need to buy into it understanding these limitations. Open ear is best for comfort and relative safety since one can still hear their surroundings.

The other open ears I've tried are the Quakkie (spelling?), Oladnace Pro, Bose Ultra Open, Shockz conduction (not truly open ear since it uses bone conduction) and the problem with all of the above is simply lack of loudness. They are all, except Shockz, very comfortable. Schocks neckband is too small (large head/neck) and it tickles.

The Tozos have the most important things going for it.... Loudness and comfort.

Wow these are so much louder than all the others I've tried and I'm very sure it's due to its ability to adjust. All the others have the tiny speaker set with minimal ability to adjust whereas the ratchet design of the hooks will likely make this device the most versatile when it comes to ear shape/fit. I'm able to actually aim the speakers directly into ear canal which is what gives it its loudness quality. This is perfectly loud enough in loud environments like a subway and likely a plane whereas the others performed terribly.

The bass is surprisingly good as well. The others were practically non-existent.

I'm really happy with this product and if you're willing to sacrifice noise cancellation and some sound quality, you'll gain a lot of comfort and some safety.

I hope future iterations, Tozo will keep the adjustability features."
Nice quality of package and ear buds. Excellent sound quality for the price point. Adjustability to fit your ear is a big plus. I would say these may not be the earbuds for you for heavy athletic use but should work for a walk or a run.
"I have been preferring wired ear buds, despite their obvious inconveniences, just because they were less likely to have sound drops. But I couldn't even find a wired ear bud that I REALLY liked, and found PLENTY of wireless ones I hated. Not to mention that they look like weird earrings and have a propensity to fall out.

So I gave these a shot. I liked that they hook onto your ears, to eliminate to falling off problem. I remember that the very first day I used them, I thought I was going to send them back. I don't remember what the problem was, but it didn't remain a problem. Then it went through a short phase that it seemed that the sound would drop a lot. Then that problem stopped, so I'm not sure whether to blame the ear buds or something else.

Now I've had them long enough to say: I definitely like them. And recommend them. With the caveats above. The sound quality is fantastic, by my standards (I have PRETTY high standards, until you get to the realm of needing absolute perfection; there comes a point in sound quality where I can't tell the difference anymore, but that's not until you enter the arena of sound engineers and people like that).

Oh, one other very interesting note. THE MICROWAVE OVEN WILL AFFECT YOUR LISTENING EXPERIENCE. Seriously! Here's how: I noticed while I was wearing the ear buds and standing by the microwave (while it was running) that the microwave oven made the audio drop out and struggle to be heard at all. Sure enough, as soon as the food was cooked, the bell went DING, and the microwave stopped, the audio jumped right back to normal. And even better: I was listening to Amazon Music (not plugging them on purpose), and, when the sound wasn't dropping out altogether, the microwave was making the music SLOW DOWN. Of all the weird effects, I never would have thought that one was even possible. When it happened on the first song, I wondered if it was my imagination. But then the second song, one that I knew well, slowed down. Then the third. The microwave was somehow making the ear buds slow down the song track, as if it were a vinyl record and you were putting your finger on the turntable to slow it down. Weird! (But true!)"
"I have a long history with earbuds and I wear them up to 16 hours a day. I have a Cottage Food business and work out of my home so I like having something to listen to while I work and I have gone through many pairs of earbuds. These are the first openbud that I have tried and I am impressed!

First the good: comfortable, good sound, ability to hear surrounding noise well when not listening without removing the buds, great quality for phone conversations. The bad - touch controls, battery life not as long as my last in-earbuds, took a bit of time to get used to.

The good far outweighs the bad and I am a convert to this style of earbud. They are extremely comfortable but they took me about 1 week of continual wear to get used to and in the beginning they caused some discomfort because of the pressure behind my ears and a feeling that something was falling out of my ear. Once I figured out the perfect adjustment for me I often forget that they are there and only have pain behind my ears very occasionally. The sound is great and I really enjoy listening to music through these. I thought that my last in-earbuds sounded fine but now I realize how awful they were. Due to the design of these they don't block outside noise the same as in-earbuds but with adjusting these inwards I can get to a level of noise cancellation that is perfectly acceptable. They are fabulous for phone calls and the quality of sound on the other end is wonderful. I especially love that I can have a conversation with my husband without removing these because when I am not listening the outside world sounds perfectly normal with no muffling.

The bad - touch controls!!!! They are truly awful and the only feature I miss about my old in-earbuds is the buttons. I hate how easy it is to accidentally pause the buds when I am scratching my ear or have it skip to the next track when I am trying to pause because my touch was too heavy. It is very cumbersome to adjust the volume and sometimes the bud will turn off instead because I touched it too long. It must be cheaper to have the touch controls instead of a button because it certainly isn't for convenience or ease-of-use. That is the sole reason that I am only giving this product 4 stars. I absolutely HATE this feature. The battery life is about 8-9 hours which isn't bad and they charge quickly so it isn't a deal breaker. My last in-earbuds lasted about 16 hours so I do miss that but 9 hours is probably perfectly fine for most users.

Overall I am very pleased with these and will not hesitate to purchase another pair when these wear out."
"These are the best over-the-ear headphones I have had yet! So good - I had to get my kiddo their own pair.

They are very adjustable, but once you find the best fit, they stay comfortably & don’t move unless you move them yourself.

They pair via Bluetooth to your device. You can pair directly through your photo settings or you can download the TOZO app. The app is nice, as you can alter audio settings for maximum enjoyment, tuned to your liking.

The headphones & charging case easily charge & last a couple days, at least. I use these headphones at least 4-6 hours a day & do not have to charge the case everyday like I did with AirPods.

They perform well, audio is great & I love that I can still hear around me & enjoy music/tv at the same time.

The colors are as expected, look just like the photos. The pink is a lovely bubblegum color & my kid loves them!

There is one button, in the center bottom of the case when you open the lid that resets the headphones. I really appreciate that being the only button for the entire unit.

The open buds are touch-sensitive, you can pause a show, skip songs or go back on your playlist & control the volume - I just haven’t taken the time to learn the touch controls yet.

Overall, this product gets 5 stars & a 10/10 rating from both myself & my kiddo. I definitely would recommend & do recommend anytime I can!"
"I tried many different earbuds, etc. Several that were 3x more in cost. These sound great and are very comfortable. I don't feel a vibration from them like some other models. They are very comfortable on my ears."
I love these and will never buy regular ear buds again. When I sweat at the gym I've had ear buds fall out many times. These stay right in place and the sound is great too for the price.
"I bought a pair of TOZO True open Ear Wireless earbuds a few weeks ago. I had a problem with the volume and contacted TOZO customer service. I received an immediate response from Lilac at Tozo. She helped me try a few ways to solve my issue, but the issue persisted. She then sent me a replacement pair which works extremely well. The service and responsiveness from Lilac was outstanding. She went the extra mile to make sure I was a satisfied customer."
"Love the following:::
Multi point - can connect to 2 devices simultaneously
Super comfy - I forget I am wearing them - sleep with them on
Great microphones/background noise cancellation
Great battery life
Amazing bass / music quality
Good customer service- but takes a few days because everything is done via email
Love that I am not isolated from my surroundings and you can even adjust them to sit farther from your ear canal if you want to hear more of what's around you
I recommend these as a super value for people considering open ear"
I liked the comfort of these open buds. Ear buds often don't stay in my ears. I feel safer wearing thes because I can hear my surroundings when I am walking.
I've gone through 6 different earbuds on Amazon. These are by far the best for the price. I can put one bud in at 6 am and the battery will last til 6 pm. The sound is good. I like to use it at work so I haven't exercised in them yet. They do seam to sit good on the ear.
"A friend clued me into these because I have a hard time wearing earbuds comfortable. I'd highly recommend them, sound quality is good and works well with all sorts of bluetooth devices."
So this is NOT to block out all sounds. It's not advertised to do that as you can hear your oustide surroundings. Which is what i wanted. The sound is great but dont expect the bass to be bumping as it's not in your ear canal. It doesn't come off with the most rigorous of activities. Loving it so far.
"I avoid the big name pods for two reasons - I lose things, and I have ridiculously sensitive ears. These solve both issues with no audible sacrifice on my part."
"I've tried several open are headphones. I was skeptical of Tozo because I wasn't familiar with the brand, but these are best I've tested. The was excited to try the new Shokz Pro2 and those aren't nearly as full and rich in sound. I haven't tested the Shokz on calls but the Tozo is excellent."
"Perfect alternative for exercise, or at street. They work just as expected, as documented in many places you will notice that the quality of sound perceived will change, is not as detailed as an earbud, this because is air conducted but is excellent to be aware of the environment, I could listen music and talk with people, also the volume capacity is enough to have enclosure if that’s what you seek."
"After about 6 months one of my earpieces malfunctioned. I contacted customer support and after a few tries to fix the earbud they replaced it without issue.

This is far superior service compared to the hassle that other, more expensive brands make you go through. Definitely 5 stars on service alone!"
"I needed these Open Bud headphones because my X1's weren't too great for working out. They'd fall out constantly leaving me pushing them back in over and over, especially while running. I love the Golden X1's but I needed a different tool for the job. So far I'm loving the comfort of the Open Buds and the sound quality of them are pretty good. I wouldn't rate them above the X1's in sound but they're definitely pretty up there. The charging case is solid for these too."
"Not happy with ""touch"" controls--stop sacrificing ease-of-use just to be more complicated/technological. Buttons/toggles work just fine. However, the sound is very impressive! The app is a bit obnoxious....it actually has the nerve to require a gender and a birthday or it won't allow you to complete the setup (I put 01/01/1901-- none of their damn business what anyone's birthday is). I like the weight and the size, however if you have larger ears, these barely reach. I have to extend the speaker to the very last notch, looks like it's broken the way it sits. Overall, I'm satisfied at the moment."
I really like them. They stay on much better than my others. The sound is good. I just got them so I’d know more in a few days.
"So the best headphones I have ever had was Momentum 2 EarBuds. They were over $200. These sound almost as good, but for 50ish dollars. I lost the case from my Momentum's, so now these are my everyday headphones. I use one of the at the time while riding the bike. Sure, they don't sounds as good, but they sound almost as good and the price is worth it. I am happy with them, and will probably buy their future upgrades"
I've watched plenty of review for these ear buds and for the most part they were positive reviews. Despite being able to customize an EQ once I got them perfectly adjusted to my ears I was very pleased with the sound and the volume. I wear them at work where I have to be alert to the guests coming into a building and they are perfect for such tasks. My right ear always suffer from ear fatigue despite what kind of headphones I purchase but I can adjust these on that ear once that happens and no more ear fatique. They are very impressive unique and I would highly recommend them!
"These were exactly what I needed. It's my 3rd pair for tozos. I'm very happy with the audio quality and fit. Good value for the money. I haven't tested call quality. Fit is comfortable great alternative to ear buds. I mainly listen to podcasts, I don't blast music. If you just want earbuds to do work or while doing an activity this is a good alternative."
"Impressive Bass, Exceptional Durability, and Long Battery Life

I have acquired the Tozo Open Buds from Amazon about 4 times and this why. I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed by their performance and features.

First and foremost, the sound quality is outstanding. The bass is rich and deep, delivering a truly immersive listening experience. Whether I'm enjoying my favorite music genres or diving into podcasts, the Tozo Open Buds consistently deliver crisp, clear sound that exceeds my expectations.

One standout feature of these earbuds is the Tozo app, which provides comprehensive control over the sound settings and additional features. Being able to customize the sound to my preferences adds a whole new level of versatility to these earbuds, ensuring that they adapt perfectly to any listening environment.

Durability is another area where the Tozo Open Buds shine. Constructed with high-quality materials, these earbuds feel sturdy and well-built. I've put them through their paces during workouts ,outdoor activities and my job, and they've held up admirably without any signs of wear or damage.

Battery life is simply exceptional. With all-day usage, I've found that the battery only depletes by a mere 7% out of 100%. This level of longevity is impressive and provides peace of mind, knowing that I can rely on these earbuds for extended periods without needing to recharge.

Lastly, I have to commend the comfort of the Tozo Open Buds. The ergonomic design and lightweight construction make them incredibly comfortable to wear for extended periods, whether I'm commuting, working, or simply relaxing at home.

In conclusion, the Tozo Open Buds have exceeded my expectations in every aspect. From their impressive bass and customizable sound to their exceptional durability and long-lasting battery life, these earbuds are a true standout in the market. I wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone in search of high-quality wireless earbuds that deliver an unparalleled listening experience. I had always wanted to own upon headphones and I made the decision to buy this brand.I can truly say that they have gained by love and trust.Outstanding.

Felipe Piazza"
I purchase the tozo earbuds and had them less than a week. And they gave me problems. I went to their website. Contacted them within a week. I had a brand new pair. The service was excellent. The people were very friendly and I do not give reviews lightly. I waited until these were about a month or 2 old. To make sure that they were going to do better than they did they are wonderful.
"I was skeptical about these earbuds at first, but wanted a set of earbuds that truly let me hear what was going on around me without having to constantly remove them or just wear one, so after a bit of looking around and going back and forth, I settled on these and so far I have not been disappointed. The open ear setup let's me hear everything around me, carry on conversations, and listen to other devices like 2 way radios, all while listening to music (at lower levels). Using them for calls works well and the microphones let anyone on the other side hear me clearly, even in noisy environments. The sound quality isn't the type an audiophile would get excited over, but that is the nature of the beast. You can't have the sound quality of an in ear earbud in an open ear design, but honestly I would call it good for what these are and at mid to upper mid levels they deliver much better quality than what I expected and are good enough for lisenting to music while on a jog or at a jobsite. Calls are always clear and I never have any problem hearing the other party. They are super confortable and stay securely in place on the ear and can be worn all day without any discomfort. For the price, these way outperform their expectations and have become my go to earbuds for day to day use. I wear these more than my Sony, Soundcore, and Beats earbuds simply because I can do more without having to mess with them every time someone speaks to me or I need to hear what's going on around me. My only real complaint about them is that the charging case feels a bit cheap and theres no way of telling if your buds are charging while in the case. But the flimsy feel of the case can be remedied by buying a case protector then you wont feel as worried about dropping it. I HIGHLY recommend these earbuds."
"The best headphones I’ve ever spent money to buy. I own so many pairs of AirPods and I hate them because they keeps falling out of my ear. These fit perfectly, stay in place, although a little too much treble, the sound is still very good. The one thing I really wish they have is the percentage display on the case, they last so long sometimes I forget they were on to take them off and charge."
"I got a replacement after filing a warranty claim on the Tozo website so 5/5 for that. However, on my original pair sometimes I get an issue with the left earphone where bass will sound a bit static or blown out speaker sound. Not sure how common this is, but might be best to get item insurance for this item, however they do abide by the warranty it seems, so I'm giving a 4/5 overall."
"I could never wear ear buds for long because they made my ears hurt (I have small ears). I could never get them to stay in well when exercising. I was quite skeptical when I bought these. I didn't think they would be noise canceling and I didn't think the sound quality was going to be good. I am so pleasantly surprised! Great sound quality, no ear pain, comfortable fit, and they don't fall off. Ever. I've taken them on runs, bike rides, hikes. I've had them for over 6 months now and they are still going strong. I have dropped the case quite a few times on hard wood flooring, tile, concrete and that has also held up very well. Great purchase."
These are the first headphones I’ve ever had that don’t hurt my ears. Finally ones that just lay over the ears !!
"I needed a pair of open air earbuds for work so that I can hear my surroundings while listening to my favorite tunes and podcasts. These open air earbuds fit perfect and have great bass! These are GREAT! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Great value.
Definitely worth the price!"
"Pretty easy to use and connect to bluetooth, but I wish the Tozo app had more functionality in terms of presetting certain sound modes. I've been using this everyday at work since purchase in 1st week of July 2024 and found that after consecutive use for 8 hours, its battery does not last very long as headphones. I pretty much have to charge it daily. I'm not sure if this is as expected, but the Tozo headphones that I got this month too, at least last me three 8 hour shifts before I have to charge it . I'm a bit disappointed the battery lifespan for both products were not very long."
I truly love this open ear headset. It is comfortable and I don't even realize I have them on. The volume is fantastic even though I do have to lower it because it can get too loud at first. I use these more than the my other product of earbuds. The value that I paid was very reasonable.
"I enjoy listening to music on the go with these open ear headphones. They allow me to hear what’s happening around me while also hearing my music. I was surprised how good the sound quality was for the price. The battery life is also decent. The only complaint I have is that they mover more than I’d like when wearing them. Overall, I would recommend these headphones if you’re looking for an affordable pair of open ear headphones that have good sound quality and all of the features."
"Recibí los audífonos y después de dos meses de uso tuve un inconveniente con ellos, no cargaban, escribí al fabricante, me enviaron algunas instrucciones para solucionarlo. No hubo solución pero me enviaron sin costo el reemplazo de mis audífonos, excelente servicio al cliente."
"I got these during Amazon Prime Days, so I had to wait weeks and weeks, but they're worth the wait. Quality is very good for open-ear, they connect fast, they're comfortable and the charge lasts for hours and hours. Highly recommended."
Just wasn't loud enough for me.
"Really good product at a good affordable price...in my mexican culture we call it the 3 b's( bueno, bonito, y barato) meaning good, nice looking, and cheap. I give this product a 9 out of 10 only because there is always room for improvement."
I absolutely LOVE these! The sound quality is amazing and I love that they are adjustable! They fit and adjust to your eqr perfectly! I love these so much that I bought a second pair for work!
My beats earbuds wouldn’t stay in my ears and the quality during calls was terrible. These are much better!
"I have ridiculously tiny ears. I've tried so many different headphone types. The ""jawbone"" types make a vibration against my skin that makes me want to climb a wall, I can't wear in-earbuds because my ear canal opening is so small (buds are PAINFUL no matter the tip size or type), and I'm usually restricted to ""kid sizes"" when it comes to on/over the ear headphones which means the sound quality tends to be on the low side. I finally set out to hopefully find something I could use since music is just part of my daily life but hey I know not everyone is into what I listen to and I needed something bluetooth.
I originally bought a different set of TOZO earbuds to see if they were small enough for me to at least wear them for a short amount of time if I needed to, unfortunately no, BUT I ended up giving them to my husband instead and he loves them.
I was so distressed by not finding something that could suit my wee ears and needs. I sifted through the other TOZO earbud stuff and these immediately caught my attention. They sounded exactly like what I wanted and needed. To my utter surprise and delight, they are *~wonderful~*. The sound quality is incredible, I often find myself listening to songs I know by heart and hearing background vocals I hadn't realized were there. Having the open ear design is perfect for me because I need to be hyper aware of whatever or whoever is around depending on where I am, but it doesn't detract from the sound quality at all which is amazing to me. I REALLY love the fact that I can just move the speaker bit away from my ear(s) instead of taking them completely off if I need to hear someone/something better. These things literally ""ratchet"" onto your ears and they are super secure for me, they're so light and the materials that go around your ear are so softly textured and designed that they don't put pressure anywhere that would be uncomfortable. I can even wear them with my heavy glasses and they're still not uncomfortable.

The only con I can say for me is that the touch controls on them are a little picky and I haven't gotten the hang of it yet. Read the booklets!!"
"These Toto Open Buds produce amazing sound at low and higher volumes. They adjust to fit the ear; no irritation, won’t fall off. They’re super easy to set up and use. Great value, lots of features, sturdy, look good, and great sound."
"I have small ears and cannot wear buds so I needed something that was comfortable, but would be loud enough to cover my husband's loud video listening next to me. They fit nicely on my ears without hurting and don't slide around so I'm hoping they will work when I am able to start walking on my treadmill again.

I liked them so much I got a pair for my husband! He wore them once to mow the lawn and they did not drown out that sound good enough so he came in and exchanged them out. He does wear them when we are sitting on the couch together and needs something to watch his videos on his phone while I binge a show on tv."
"I finally found headphones that work for me.
I am a runner and I have small ears - not an easy combination when looking for headphones. After purchasing numerous kinds of headphones and having them fall out of my ears along the way, I figured out I need the over the ear style. On top of that, I keep finding wireless ear buds that suddenly stop charging on one side - seems to be an issue as multiple brands have wrestled with this. Thankfully, these TOZO OpenBuds are charging great because these have been a huge find for me.
PROS
- They are lightweight and comfortable with no irritation on my ears
- They fit my ears - I can't explain how shocking this is and how excited I am to have these for running or just around the house. They hold tight. The design actually has a ratcheting feel as it tightens down on the ear.
- They reconnect to my phone every morning - my Soundcore Spirit X2 buds have really been struggling with that
- The open concept is surprisingly effective - I run and was worried that outside wind and noise would punish the sound quality but that is not the case. You literally feel the bass and treble/voices are still distinguishable.
- The open concept allows for me to now hear cars coming (I run in a neighborhood) and can actually respond when someone says hello
- No bleed - if you have ever been next to someone oversharing from their earphones, you know why this is a big deal. I asked my wife to tell me what it was like sitting in our kitchen while I listened to my music (fairly loud) and she said she could make out the beat (again about the impressive bass) but otherwise nothing really distracting
- They are charging well - so far - a week into use (I have run with them every day)
- The buttons are easy to use even while bouncing along in my run
CONS
- The buttons can be a little too sensitive - when reaching up to check they're secure to my ear, I can accidentally pause the music (but it is easy to get it going again).
- They can be hard to put on one handed (mostly because of the sensitivity).
- With the open design, you do lose the feeling of being immersed in the sound since it doesn't seal on your ear/canal. I run in a suburb which doesn't have an enormous amount of loud noise but if I was in the city, I don't think it would work very well.

Bottom line, I am thrilled that I've found these. They are my go to for running and for everyday use around the house (my wife is excited that she can get my attention LOL). When I want to be immersed, i have a pair of over-ear style that are great. I really hope it continues to charge well and the part that goes over the ear stays tight. I am very pleased for the sound quality - especially for this price point! TOZO has become a go to brand for me. The one time I had an issue they were so quick to resolve it which I find very commendable. Hope you'll try these - especially if you have small ears or are looking for some great, affordable over the ear wireless open buds."
"Tl;dr - Here’s what you probably came here to find out:

- Sound quality is phenomenal. Deep bass and rich crystal clear highs. Hands down better than AirPods Pro 2, and significantly so imo.

- Battery life is the longest I’ve ever experienced, once again shaming Apple.

- Noise cancelling is great. For this, I’d say it’s equal to AirPods Pro 2, if not slightly better.

- They fit very snugly in my ears and don’t fall out with movement. They come with three pairs of ear tips, each a different size.

- Very good construction and premium feel. They also look really good.

- The charging case can either be charged with a type-C wire, or on any wireless charger by laying them down on the charging pad.

- The Skullcandy IQ app is actually useful with features such as custom EQ, voice control configuration, ANC controls, etc.

Long version:

Borrowed my Wife’s AirPods Pro 2 off and on for a week before deciding to give these a go as they were 50% off, and as someone who listens to metal and hard rock, these things absolutely murder Apple’s flagship buds. As far as sound quality and loudness, going from the AirPods Pro 2 to these was like going from ramen noodles to premium ribeye. The bass is right where it should be, and the treble is crystal clear and clean. Loud is an understatement. I use Spotify Premium and am happy with the EQ within that app, but the EQ within the Skullcandy app is really great as well. These are made well and feel great. Battery is roughly 6-7 hours, so really great. They fit great, are very comfortable, and don’t fall out with movement. All in all, these buds are amazing. Apple can’t compete."
"I love the volume and Bass on these guys. The different size tips are perfect..well for me they are, they stay in my ears no matter what I'm doing , the app is helpful. The equalizer is awesome. I'd love louder, but that's just my preference, I want it to rattle my brain literally, they're loud, don't get me wrong. Only dislike, more of a little annoyance is, they're very touchy, it's not a deal breaker, I've gotten used to it already. They last all day as far as battery, my right seems to ALWAYS drain quicker, it's weird, but again, not a deal breaker. I will honestly say, I've tried so many brands, and skullcandy is just IT , every aspect, skullcandy is IT. Keep it up skullcandy , great job. Can't wait to see what's next."
"Are they comparable to some of the top brands? If you consider price, they may be better. My previous buds include Bose and Samsung so this is the basis for my comparison. Pairing was uneventful and the Skull IQ app is easy to use. ANC and Stay Aware feature work as advertised. Fit is comfortable and secure. Audio is more than acceptable; especially is you use the Skull IQ app to customize the sound as well as the included hearing test portion of the app to create a personalized profile. For those that suggest there is not enough bass, I recommend using the app to customize the sound and make sure that the buds are tightly fitted. I would buy them again for the price I paid (not sure why but my price was 49.88 new). Might shop harder at the $89 current price."
"Edit: added more at the end

If you had an allergic reaction to Samsung Buds 2 or their other earbuds, you'll react to these as well. I wore the Rail ANC for less than one afternoon and by dinner my ears were already reacting with liquid discharge. This morning at 4am I had one ear almost totally crusted over and still leaking while the other was leaking but less crusted. I've had this reaction before and I suspect it's the material used for the inserts. Also, the little logo they put on them didn't help either. Anything that causes friction in the ear canal is a stupid idea. I got these for a trip I'm taking on a plane across country and I'm kinda screwed now because I can't return them in time to get something else. My old wired headphones from when I bought my Samsung pgone don't react, so I took those ear inserts and luckily they fit, so I through them on. Once my ears stop reacting and chill out, I'll see if that fixes the issue in time for my trip.

As far as function goes, the headphones are okay at best. They can get plenty loud to the point that ANC or their Stay Aware pass through mode mean nothing. It's nice to know I can listen at lower volumes like I prefer and still have ambient noise be mostly audible or have anc keep things subdued. But subdued is the best they give and mostly audible ambient noise is about as much as you can expect. These aren't stellar at either. Doable, but not something I'd laude about.

They sound pretty good for what they are. Not sure if I'd say they're $100 headphone quality or value, allergies aside, but they don't sound awful by any means. Music was clear and had some rumble. I used the sound personalization and it was easy enough to get decent sound. There a bass boost, general music and podcast sound setting with a customizable equalizer in the app as well.

The buttons on the side are touch activated and finicky. I tend to tap fast and expect fast responses, but these prefer a more methodical pace. The sweetspot for where to touch is also funky, but I started getting it after a few hours. Also, the audio queues are clear enough, but an option to remove them would make things feel faster. Also, if they're not in my ear, I wish touch capacity stopped. Plenty of time I took one out and accidentally started changing tracks, changing volume and activating pairing mode.

I remapped all the touch responses and even changed what ear did what. One tap on either paused, double tap on left was volume down, on right it's volume up. Three taps left was previous track and same on the right was skip ahead. Long press in either toggles ANC on/off and pass through audio. I appreciate customization like that.

For what stands out as good, I'd say it's the voice prompts. Much quicker to respond than on my phone or watch and that's kinda sad because it's the feature I'll probably never use and cared rhe least about, but seemed so much better than my phones inbuilt assistant that Samsung spent so much time, effort and money on to develop (rip bixby). If you like using voice commands, that's gonna go great, although the ""take photo"" command doesn't work with my Samsung's camera app. Again, not something I was after anyways.

One of my favorite features was the built-in tile function for finding them if I lose one or both. The tile app isn't super intuitive, but I mostly figured it out and stumbled my way into it connecting both buds. It creates a tone I can hear when the room in my apartment is silent and has a directional sensor to let me know if I'm getting hotter or colder. Granted, it's not terribly responsive, sensitive or consistent, but if I moved slowly through a room, I bet between the proximity sensor and sound I'd probably find one if I lost one. It's a nice feature to have where I'd otherwise be totally screwed, so I'll take a win where I can with these.

I got these on pre-order. When they were scheduled to release after 2 weeks, they ended up coming 10 days earlier or less. It seems weird i had to pre-order when people said they were already at Walmart for a couple weeks, but whatever.

I'll update after my ears recover and try them using the non-reactive ear inserts from my old wired heaphones and see if they don't react again. I was furious about my Galaxy Buds 2 causing this reaction, but my wired stuff and my LG Tone Platinums never caused an issue. If it weren't summer and the LG Tone Platinums weren't makeing my neck hot, I might never have bothered looking at this style Bluetooth buds again. But it's a trip to a Nevada training center after the hottest july month on record in human history with averages around 110 in the area I'll be. I thought I'd take a chance on mild comfort. I'm hoping I didn't waste my money now that almost out of time.

EDIT: It's been a few days so I'll add more input. Battery is pretty good, but it's not enough to bump a star.

The app Skullcandy IQ is awful. It's what controls your key presses. The problem is the app is always on, but loses connection and resets all your programmed key presses. I end up having to reset them every day when they eventually connect poorly. The app logo constantly in my phones notification bar isn't necessary or tell me any input about my headphones. If it at least told me battery levels or connection status, maybe I wouldn't be so annoyed, but this just ISN'T ready for prime time.

Also, the ear inserts are what caused the allergic reaction. They jerryrigged replacements I found by chance from a totally different set of wired buds from an old phone work well enough, but I shouldn't have to find my own replacements. At least having an option for different inserts that are non-reactive would be beneficial like memory foam or whatever. Again, Samsung Buds 2 had this EXACT issue and replacing inserts with an aftermarket set was the only solution. For a list of symptoms, it's pretty unmistakable: liquid discharge, discolored mucousal discharge in ear, weeping ear, flaking and scaly skim that seems to build up and shed, pain itching, inflammation, basically a large skin irritation in your ear canal that, if unmanaged, becomes a severe ear infection. Samsung got sued for it and has been paying out for their affected customers. Skullcandy is headed the same way with these unless they have a hypoallergenic replacement in the wing.

If the connectivity issue wasn't so bad and not saving my preset remapped button setting wasn't so annoying, perhaps I would add a star or two, but this isn't ready for release and I'm probably returning after giving another day or two. Really sucks I'm screwed out of my trip for headphones, but I'm not gonna struggle with a new set of buds I paid good money for. I'll just go back to wired at this point."
"Normally my reviews are very short and to the point however this one's going to be a little bit longer. I didn't think that these would actually be worth it but in fact they are. There are extremely many features that are missing on very expensive earbuds. And I'm talking the big brands...

First I'll tell you that when you do set up with the app a hearing test it actually does work it helps greatly especially if ones hearing isn't what it used to be. Secondly, as with most, you can set your equalizer to your own personal settings if you want to. The sound, or music, actually doesn't sound awful again I was a bit surprised. Now another thing that is usually a problem for me just keeping my buds in my ears at all times. Well please actually stay in perfectly and they don't hurt one bit and that's using them for at least 9 hours in a row without taking them out. The battery life as far as I know it looks like it might be pretty good unfortunately I haven't given it enough time to judge that but by the usage I have had with the buds they seem to hold up relatively well with ambient on. Basically I'm very satisfied with these I will keep them and hope that they do keep them updated as they should when needed.

Now one con is the app is a pain in the butt. It has to always know you're nearby settings it always ask you to have Bluetooth on, which is already on and the buds are already connected before you get into the app. I don't get that one maybe they'll fix it and the other which is unfortunately the case. The case is a bit flimsy and when you want to try to keep the lid open it keeps falling down so I think that that was a architectural design flaw other than that they're definitely worth it I'll get over the case problem all I have to say is if you want them you'll be happy with them. Used with an Android device."
"I have long been a fan of Skullcandy headphones and earbuds, at least 10 - 15 years. The earbuds were always decent and sturdy, even if you got cheaper ones.

My last pair of true wireless earbuds were the Skullcandy Indy earbuds, and I was so sorry to see these were no longer being made.

But I was looking forward to the Rail ANC earbuds. First, ANC! Second, a decent IPX4. Third, great battery life. Plus, they cost more, so they must be higher quality, right? So I splurged a little on June 28, 2024. These earbuds sound pretty good. I can tell only a minor difference when the ANC is on and when it's off. The passthrough mode is okay, maybe about as good as the Indy's. The battery life was amazing. That's right. Was. We'll get to that. I loved using the app SkullIQ, where you can customize control settings. I was able to change what the number of taps on the sensor does. Super cool!

My list of gripes as of 8/23/2024.

First of all, how did my right earbud stop working within the first month? There's a sound when you press the sensor. Within 2 weeks, it started randomly making the sensor pressing sound. Then it started saying Pairing... pairing... as if I was doing long single presses. Then it started skipping to the next track(triple press) and trying to start Spotify* (double press). Within the first month it just wouldn't power on at all. I tried all the tricks and worked with Skullcandy support to no avail. They suggested I submit a warranty claim.

*Sidenote: how does it fail to open Spotify whether I'm listening to Spotify or not?).

Sometimes they will connect to my phone even thought they are in their case and should be off. My Indy's would do this, too, but it took at least a year or two before that started. This started within the first two months.

Every once in a while they wont even connect and you will have to go to settings, forget device, then pair them to your phone again. This is what Skullcandy support had me try to fix the right earbud. Occasionally I need to do this on the left earbud as well. Well if you do this, you have to customize the SkullIQ app again.

The case is cheap. My Indy's case was solid and sturdy. It had a few LEDs to indicate how much battery life was left in the case. This new one is flimsy with one light that shows you if the battery is being charged or not.

Lastly, the Indy's stayed in my ears much better than the Rail's do. So I'm constantly needing to readjust them in my ears. With a name like Rail, I figured it was made for an active lifestyle. I wash windows for a living, but these things don't stay in my ears too well.

As of today, they are in the mail headed to San Diego for the warranty claim. Hopefully, I get a somewhat better product when it's returned."
"I've had lots of ear buds, these are by far one of the best! They hold a charge foe a long time, comfortable in your ear, performance is great, charges fast, very durable and sound is stability. Great value for the money."
"I previously owned the Skullcandy dime2 earbuds, but I was having to charge them every few days. With these earbuds, the battery life lasts considerably longer saving me from having to charge them constantly. The case is very sturdy and the noise cancellation is superb. Because of the sound quality and noise cancellation I can listen to music in a noisy gym without having to crank the volume way up. I am glad I spent the extra money on these rather than getting the dime 2 earbuds again."
"Im gonna keep it short and simple. When i got them price was great and the sound quality is also great lowk. Only thing that should be better is the ANC because I tried them on and off and theres barely a difference in loud or quiet areas. It really just mutes background noise like air conditioning or something small. Either than that they are really good.

Also i’ve had airpods pro 2 and to me the ANC to them are way better than the Rails but the for the price difference its understandable"
"Love these headphones, they work great and the ANC helps a lot when I need to focus, affordable price too, my only gripe would be they can get a bit uncomfortably wearing them for extended periods of time seeing how they aren’t exactly breathable"
"These earbuds are great, they have a long battery life, are comfortable with good sound. I've yet to find a pair of these that will stay in my ear completely but these stay in longer than any others I've had. Skull candy makes great products and for the cost you can't beat these."
Every now and then the Bluetooth would forget the device gets kinda annoying besides that they sound great!
"Have had many different Skullcandy earbuds and these are the best so far. Very comfortable and the sound is really good. Disappointed that they use a different app to mange then the previous models and that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

I love the fact that you can pair to 2 devices at once. I use this at work and can pair to my work laptop and my phone at the same time. Really love that feature. Battery life is good and the case isn't overly big and easy to carry in your pocket."
"I've had these for a while now > 6 months. I have to say that the ANC feature doesn't work at all. I've had other ANC offerings from other manufacturers and this doesn't block outside noises at all. I have a set of Skullcandy Grind (non ANC) and the noise suppression enjoyed by the ear canal seal works as good or better than this ANC.
I have had numerous Skullcandy earbuds and like the brand and most of their earbuds offer a nice sound for a fair price, except this one. Also, I have this set paired with my iPhone and my Windows 10 Laptop, the iPhone app is the only way to control the features of the Rail detailed features, I wish there were a windows app.
Bottom line is if you are looking for an ANC earbud, look elsewhere. Skullcandy offers a nice variety of fair priced other earbuds, but not these. At least my $0.02."
"Llevo poco más de un mes usando los audífonos y han funcionado muy bien. Los utilizo para hacer ejercicio y trotar y permanecen bien sujetos al oído, no se caen. El sonido está muy bien y el control por vos facilita mucho su manejo. Son livianos y su batería también tiene muy buena duración."
"The sound is what you would expect from Skullcandy, really bass heavy, which I enjoy. I like being able to use the Skullcandy app with these earbuds. With the app you can change the equalizer, switch sound modes, and customize the touch functions. I also like The voice control function. The only thing that I have a slight problem with is the fit. I use these headphones while I work and as I get sweaty they start to slip out a little bit and I have to stop and readjust. But other than that I really enjoy these headphones"
"After trying these out for a month I have decided that I don't particularly enjoy the product. They do sound great but the caveat is the reliability in pairing.

The pros:
Great sound, awesome EQ options, the app allows a bunch of personal customization settings that I did enjoy.

The cons:
The gesture button is smack dab on the rear of the headphone driver. When I would push in the headphones to secure them in my ear better, while listening to them or on the phone, I would always pause/hang up on accident.
The EQ settings stay the same for both music and phone calls. I like some bass in my music.. but not so much on my phone calls.
By far the killer of this product is the amount of times I had to re-pair the headphones to my phone. It is very inconvenient to do especially when I am in a rush and need to make a call.

I'm always on the go, and rely on headphones heavily for entertainment and business. For a casual user these buds are great. But they are not good a good workhorse product."
bought it as a gift for my brother. he liked it. but from my perspective it feels a bit cheap. the plastic body seems very undurable
Sounds cool like their previous earbuds but as the previous the main downside is that they fall off a bit to easy for me no matter what eartip I use provided in the package.
"They are perfect! I really love that you can customize what you want tapping each earned to mean. Like skip a song, volume, pause, all of it. It's so helpful! LOVE these!"
I am a big fan of the Skullcandy brand. I was very happy with the purchase price and how easy they were to connect- and even charge with my charging pad. Very pleased with the overall range.
"I had skull candy headphones as a kid, and loved them. Granted, this is back when headphones still physically plugged into a device or phone. So when I saw these I was super excited. Unfortunately, they ended up being the LEAST enjoyable earbud I have purchased, yet. Before you read further, it is worth noting that a lot of people are super satisfied with these earbuds, so it is extremely likely that this is more about my user preferences not matching with the specs of the item. That being said, the following are the agitations and the positives I’ve experienced since using them:

THE CONS:
• The earbuds regularly don’t sync with my phone & I am prompted at least 3x a week to “forget” the earbuds and then go through the pairing process again. Not a huge problem, but a mild inconvenience made worse by the regularity in which it happens.
• The earbuds fall out of my ears from my jaw moving, which happens often, because my jaw moves when I talk on the phone.
• The earbuds require an app to be downloaded to my phone, in order to customize each button sequence to the desired function (I.e. answer phone, play music, skip forward, etc.). The frustration I have with this is that the earbuds can answer a phone call with a tap, but they cannot end the call with a tap. So, in order to hang up, I have to use my phone screen (or wait for the person I’m talking with to hang up).
• The earbuds verbalize information about the device, each time you put them in your ear. I can see how some people might prefer this, but I prefer just a simple one or two note “chime” to let me know the earbud is connected to the device. These earbuds state the following, each time I put them in: *chime*… pause… “Battery at __%”… pause… “connected”. This will happen, even if you’re listening to music or are actively talking on the phone & you swap earbuds. Again, not a huge problem, but a frequent nuisance.

THE PROS:
Now, despite these gripes, I will say that the sound quality of both phone calls and music are REALLY good (for the price of the earbud). Moreover, I have used AirPods, Beats Pro, and JBL earbuds… and I have had a few people tell me that the sound quality of my voice for them (when on the phone) is noticeably better. I did not ask these people before hand, they voiced it on their own accord. One person even said “did you get new headphones?! I can hear you so much better now!”. For these reasons, despite my many personal gripes, I am keeping the headphones. But buyer beware, they are definitely frustrating at times."
"I purchased these in November 2023 and have been using them regularly for the past few months. The sound quality is amazing, I absolutely adore the “personal sound” through the app it uses. It connects really easily, barely a hassle. I like the added features, like how it can connect to Spotify instantly and play from the earbuds, or how it can detect whether or not you’re listening to an audiobook/podcast and adjust volumes accordingly. I also like the noise cancelling, it has a slider where you can adjust how much or how little you’d want. Overall, when it comes to the sound, it knocks it out of the ballpark.

Though, one of my only gripes with it is the fit. It wasn’t built for movement. Even walking around with it indoors, it tends to pop out unless I continually push it back in. I’ve tried the multiple ear tips provided, but it doesn’t seem to help much. The other gripe I have with it is the controls, and how sensitive it is. Remember how I mentioned I have to continually push it back in? Well, 9/10 times I’ll accidentally pause the song, skip, or start pairing mode. The touch controls are nice, but I wish it wasn’t as sensitive, because the slightest poke sends it into a frenzy.

Overall, it’s amazing if you’re just using it at home, stationary. The sound and battery life is phenomenal. If you plan to use it on the go, walking to and from places, etc. I’d advise to go elsewhere."
"Awesome sound from these little ear buds. Great for working out or just chilling. I am able to hear what is going on around me so going out for a run I can still hear traffic or others around me. That feature can be turned off so if i want to immerse myself in the music or a movie, I can do that as well. I am real pleased with the quality of sound and the excellent bass these have. Highly recommend."
"Out of the box, I wasn’t a big fan of these. The sound was pretty tinny and pretty weak. I saw someone recommend the Movie mode in the EQ. That helped a little bit. But the real change was when I went into the custom EQ setting and played around with it. The sound is awesome now. I put it behind my AirPod Pros, but ahead of all the other earbuds I have.

I did only give it 4 stars because of the noise cancellation, or lack thereof. If you’re going to tout the feature in the name of the product, at least put some effort into it. I hardly notice a difference from when it’s on or off."
"Los compré por el descuento que al final fue lo único de atractivo. No sé si es mi oreja, la forma del auricular o qué pero con ninguna de las 3 almohadillas me siento cómodo a los pocos segundos de acomodarlos se mueven y el sonido se filtra dejando inservible el ANC. Pensé que la calidad de sonido iba a ser mejor, no se que tan mal estoy juzgando pero siento que suenan a auriculares chinos. Vi reseñas en Youtube y decían que al principio el sonido era malo pero con actualizarlos esto mejoraría bastante (Desde que abrí los míos me salió que están en la última version, en lo personal nunca los actualicé yo mismo) pero al menos resuelven. Hace par de años tuve unos Indy Evo y me encantaban esos auriculares hasta q se los comió mi perro, no puedo sentirme así con estos"
"Ok I've used these for a few months now. The sound is great, I'm more partial to bass and these delivered. The noise cancelling was really good no complaints there. The stay aware feature needs more work, the outside noise I could only hear if the volume was at the lowest setting. The Tile feature, is freaking awesome! Iost these bad boys a couple times and found them easily when connected with Tile. The battery life is also really good, I have only run out of juice once when I had a busy day.

For the most part, everything worked really good. But there is one thing that is annoying but I'm dealing with because everything works awesome. I have to re-map the buttons the way I want at least once a week. It only takes a few moment but it is super annoying."
"I really like these headphones but there were a few things I didn't like.

I love the touch controls but when working out and sweating the controls are triggered. Ends up pausing and skipping songs while I'm workout out. I turned off the touch controls but it's a pain always reaching for my phone.

Not loud enough when in the gym. Planet, LA and 24hr fitness all play pretty loud music and I can still hear it when I have the headphones all the way up. Played with all the settings and it just wasn't good enough for me.

For now I'll stick with my grind fuels"
I have had many ear buds over the years and these are the best I’ve had. The app you use with them offers great customization. I’m sure there are better but at a much higher price point. Definitely worth the purchase
"I am a big fan of the SC line of ear buds. Let's get that out of the way. I own a set of Grind and Push Active, currently, and the case for the Push stopped charging, which is why I am here.

I had really high hopes for these and was really let down. I purchased a set (XT) from Walmart and they sounded terrible. I returned them and saw these on sale and got them, thinking they might be different. The Walmart set was tagged with the 'XT' qualifier, so I didn't know if there were different components used in them.

There aren't.

1. I feel like I have average sized hands for a dude, so I don't know why I seem to fumble with getting the buds out and into the case. And when I say fumble, I'm talking about the kind of fumble that causes them to fall down a storm drain 10 feet away. I have had to hunt them down because they shot across the room when getting them out. I don't do that with my other sets. I feel like its my technique, but I dont know what the right one is...
2. Touch Sensitivity is off the charts. I cannot turn up the volume, turn on ANC or anything else without accidentally pausing what I am listening to, EVERY SINGLE TIME. If you want to take one out to talk to someone, don't hold it in your hand. Now my boss knows I listen to Hailee Steinfeld, and SkullCandy is to blame. 100%. Thanks... I stopped using this feature, I lost patience and went back to doing everything on my phone. This may be a ""give it time"" thing or maybe making pause/play three taps is the answer.
3. The sound. It's kinda bad... especially when you get up in volume. Even at about 75% I can hear distortion and they're no louder than my other sets at 75%. This is why I returned the XT to Walmart, because of this distortion. I do not have this issue with the Grind or Push Active, even at 100%.

I don't know what happened.

The positives:
1. The announcement is toned down and less obtrusive. So if someone calls and I want to put them in, I dont have to pause my convo for 45 seconds. I can hear over it enough now to understand what's being said.
2. The bass on them is really f'in nice, which is what I wanted when I bought these. I think this is the trade-off with distortion though, which is a major bummer. I will say that when these things get rockin with a nice bass track that doesn't distort, they can wiggle themselves right out of your ear. All you have to do is push them back in...

pause..."
"These sound great and fit well, but I often have to forget/delete them and re-find to connect."
"My wireless skull candy ear buds are perfect for me. I use them while working outside, and find the easy pause on them is awesome. If I need to pause my music I simple tap on the outer side of one of the ear buds and the music pauses. To start again just a simple tap. The case they come it great also. Its a mini storage case that charges my ear buds within the safety of the case. Love it"
Great sound and ease of use. The noise cancelling feature works really well.
bought these for my mom and she likes them but they don't want to turn off when you put them back in the lil box which made it so she couldn't hear anything on her phone.
"Bought these during Amazon's Black Friday sale with the express purpose of listening to music at work. Up until today (3/5/2024), when this review is being written, ownership has been fantastic. The Rail ANC earbuds performed effortlessly and are light-years ahead of my previous earbuds from Gravastar. However, one earbud, the left specifically, has ceased to emit any sound. Its touch and ANC features still operate, but there is zero sound emitted through the speaker. This is the first time an earbud or similar device has done this in my experience, and while I know nothing is perfect forever, but I am wondering how it happened. I have my volume set to its lowest setting and do not drop, abuse, or otherwise mistreat the device. When not in use, both earbuds are stored in the charging case. I should also add that I did attempt to pair the earbuds as if for the first time and the left earbud still refused to emit any sound. A disappointment to an otherwise fantastic product."
"These earbuds are really good sound wise and noise cancelling wise! The battery on them is also really good. However they do have a bunch of annoying issues. For example sometimes they will connect to your phone even thought they are in their case and should be off. Every once in a while they wont even connect and you will have to go to settings, forget device, then pair them to your phone again. And if you had custom control settings you will have to redo that in the app again. I recently had another issue where one of them was not charging and I basically had to wait for it to die and then it charged… like huhh. Overall the earbuds are good listening wise and battery wise I even like them better than the airpods but they just have so many tedious issues that kinda ruins it. Also the case just feels a little cheap/flimsy hahah."
Darn near perfect except for occasional cutting out. Noise cancelling is 🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾 as per usual with SkullCandy. Don’t know why anyone would spend more $$$ for other brands.
Good
"I love the sound and the ANC. The ringing in my ears has finally died down. I wish they would allow more app compatibility on user app though. My preference is Pandora and while it does play on headphones, it fights with Spotify, because that it the default player. I wish they would allow the user to choose the default player. The earbuds have excellent sound, but the controls are very sensitive and activate at the slightest touch, which is slightly annoying.
** Update - the right earbud became intermittent, then the audio cut out completely, the controls still worked, but no more audio. I have sent the earbuds back to the company for warranty and I am currently waiting either for a new set or my repaired earbuds. Will update when I found out which."
"I don’t usually write reviews, but this was worthy of it. The sound is way better than AirPod pros. A little louder than the AirPod pro. The ANC is good not as good as AirPods but good. The comfort level is way better than AirPod and the price is exceptional."
"I've enjoyed using them. I love them. I have a friend interested in getting a pair.
Performance is excellent, button are easy. Charging is fast. Very comfortable. Easy to pick up and go"
"I really like these earbuds. They fit comfortably, great sound quality, great microphone. The battery use life between recharging seems kind of short. From fully charged to 30% in about 3 hours. The case recharges them quite fast. However, they fall out, no matter which pieces are used. Maybe it's the shape of my ear canal. But with the effort required to keep pushing them back in and the placement of the ""buttons"" on the piece, I end up disconnecting calls on the regular. If don't keep pushing them back in, they will fall out and then I'm scrambling on the zoom call to find the errant earbud that is now under my desk. Next time, I'll get the ones that have the over the ear loop."
"Unfortunately the design on these don't stay in your ear. It will constantly fall out your ear everytime you move or make a facial expression it starts chipping away out your ear.

Not only that cause it falls out your ear alot you have to readjust it to push it back In and the annoying part about that is the ear buds are touch sensitive meaning they habe touch sensitive buttons. So just touching the dumb earbuds pauses the audio or goes into this annoying voice announcer about switching into some kind of Spotify mode or something.

It ends up being like you're dealing with a annoying misbehaved kid while you're trying to enjoy any peace time. It's just a hassle to use them.

Other than that it would be a solid wireless ear buds if it weren't for these issues.

I like that when you turn them on it tells you how much battery life it has.

It has light indicators on the charger to let you know how much battery is left.

You can add bass on the app with the app adding other customizations.

I will say I'd like it if the volume was a tad bit louder than it is but again other than that it would have been a good product without the mentioned issues."
"The battery life in these earbuds are great. I normally only need to use one at a time and I don’t need to worry about missing music because it needs both earbuds, it recognizes just one being used and the audio adjusts. It works awesome for making phone calls. Everyone can hear me from either ear bud. This was a great purchase."
"They do work well and connected easily, the ANC is not very great by any means kind of a let down, the sensitivity of the button on the headphones is to much I don’t like that at all, the earbuds them selves as well are a little rough on the ears, I have the same issue with the old apple AirPods, over all tho not to bad for the price"
"Great pair headphones, skullcandy never miss with their mids, bass no questions asked. Comfortable fit to the point I fall asleep with them in my ears, waking with no pain from pressure points. Great battery life, however the Noise canceling is waaaaaay beyond disappointing, turn it on and I noticed there's barely any difference. Other than that still a great pair headphones I would recommend."
I like this brand because it isn't apple or the tiny buds that fall out of your ears. These fit but I do wish it had the wings like the Indy that stay in the ear better. The sound quality is amazing but you do need an app to maximize the features. I am happy with it and the wireless charging is nice. The other downside is the batter indicator light is a single blinking light instead of the 4 lights on the Indy. I recommend these and make sure to get the anc because without it these aren't worth it. The anc is good and can cut down 95% of my vacuum cleaner noise.
Good sound and ease of use
"I bought these after using the ANC Sesh for over a year after seeing that the battery life was supposed to be better than the ANC Sesh by a few hours. That was definitely not the case. With the ANC Sesh I could listen to music almost all day without having to charge them. With these I'd be lucky to got 3 hours before having to charge them and the headphones case battery runs out so much quicker. Very disappointed as I listen to music all day, every day while working."
"Music comes alive with this earbud. It’s can blow away the other expensive earbuds.
Not fit comfortable in the ear but it’s ok because the price is too good."
Great product
The sound is awesome
Tiene buen sonido
"After using these for about a month, I'm impressed with the sound and bass quality. However, I noticed that after a few hours of use, my ears start to feel a bit uncomfortable. This might be just me, but it's something to consider."
"Fir the price it's great, just too bad you have to have the app open for the equalizer to be adjusted, then they are amazing"
No cons all pros
"Better sound than her old ones. Flimsy material, but didn't haven't broke like her old ones. Software is unnecessary."
"I really do like them. Although they require a whole different Skullcandy app than the Indy evos do. And the battery life isn’t the best. I’ve used the ear bud for little over an hour, when I put it in, it was at 90% and now it’s saying battery low. I liked my almost two year old Indy evos more. Maybe with more use I’ll like these better but the actual ear bud life isn’t the best.

Now the right earbud doesn’t work at all. Won’t connect or say battery life. Really disappointed with these"
"The sound quality and fit on these are great. I wish the ""stay aware"" audio mode actually passed more ambient sound, but overall they're great.

Update: still loving these, but have noticed the touch controls stop working when I'm in direct sunlight. They get hot and stop responding to touch. They still work, but I do have to use my phone to pause the music."
You have to pay return through Skullcandy. One of the ear buds didn't work and they wouldn't exchange through Amazon. We had to pay to ship then back to Skullcandy but they did offer a generous exchange budget to buy new ones through their website.
These earbuds are really well constructed. The sound is excellent and I highly recommend these.
"The Skullcandy RAIL's offer a mix of impressive features but still has a few limitations. The Bluetooth connectivity is exceptional, ensuring a seamless pairing process, stable connection, and quick reconnection. The device excels in battery performance, boasting extended life and rapid charging capabilities. However, it falls short for gaming enthusiasts due to noticeable latency issues, impacting the overall gaming experience. Additionally, it's worth noting that the Skullcandy RAIL's do not have in-ear detection. Despite these limitations, the Skullcandy RAIL remains a strong contender for those prioritizing top-notch audio in their daily activities. What makes it even more appealing is that it offers these features at a great value for the money."
"This is a mixed review for me honestly . I like skullcandy for the audio quality and loudness, but when i make calls only some of who i call hear me well even with the ANC active."
Cancelación mala. Mejor compra el no ANC.
"I've been using the Skullcandy Indy Anc's but since I lost them I've switched over to the Rail Anc and it was worth it. The case, for starters, is more beautiful and distincable than I thought it would be with the glossiness at the top and and blue led light on this inside. The sound quality was good but I had higher expectations for the $100 I was spending. My only complaints would be the fact that they are a little too slippery in my ears so they're sometimes on the verge of falling out and the connectivity issues that I experienced with the Indy Anc. Overall an amazing set of earbuds to grab if you're looking for something reliable."
"Surprisingly good noise cancelling even when volume is very low. Neighbors have horrendous large barking dogs they do not control, these cancel that noise out, without having to blow my ear drums out with volume so loud. The bass is really strong too. I also like the app that has various settings for headphones, I am a bass head so I appreciate the pre-set equalizer that enhances bass. The only con is battery life is shorter than some other brands, but I'll take that for the much better noise cancelling in this price range. Great option for this price range.

I tried Anker noise cancelling ear buds, but they really could not compete with these as I had to have volume up almost max for same noise cancelling effect. At that point its merely just the louder noise blocking another less loud noise versus noice cancelling."
"Great bass, awesome sound, long battery life and the ANC is actually pretty good. For the price, you can’t go wrong."
"Wow, Easy to use, good looking, less expensive than I-crap, & other $200 buds etc. .... Give them a try, you'll be pleasantly SURPRISED !!!"
Great earbuds but the active noise cancellation is a joke
"Amazing value for the price! I’ve been using it daily, and it hasn’t disappointed me yet.
Very satisfied!!"
First pair had to send back cuz one wouldn't charge. Second set one only charges part way. Cool that they sync to dual devices. And voice control is nice. Sound is alright. But not worth full price.
"I've been a Skullcandy user for almost 20 years. I recently purchased and love them, the app is simple, syncing is easy. Sound is great, talking on call is good, voice command is awesome and I love the 2 ways your able to charge the earbuds. Definitely great value and Quality for what you pay for. I also love the way the look. The battery life is amazing. I've used them at work, the gym and pretty much all the time. My only critique is making them fully waterproof but are at least water and sweat resistant."
"Most headphones and earbuds lack any deep bass and can sound tinney at best. I have a pair of Skullcandy headphones that have exceptional bass with great highs and midranges. So, I thought, lets try the earbuds. I was blown away by the strong deep bass and again, exceptional sound quality. The app gives you the ability to further enhance your sound quality. So, if you are looking for quality sound with that strong deep vibrating bass, these earbuds work perfectly."
"If you want a lesser expensive earbuds, these are comfortable, high quality, sound amazing and I honestly would buy these over the other high priced brands"
"It’s alright, I bought it when it was on sale and I’ve had it for almost a month, and within the last week my left ear piece kept not working and somehow even when I cough the audio just disappears in my left ear piece which makes absolutely no sense to me. Makes sense why it was on sale, I honestly would not buy this headphones again if I had to choose."
"had them for about 3 months, lost them so bought another pair, very comfortable, great sound quality, great bass, amazing customization. only thing bad about them is sometimes they have trouble connecting but other than that amazing"
"Absolutely loved my purchase! The sound is so clean and crisp, unlike anything I've ever used in the past."
"First the pros: great sound with control in the iq app. Ease of changing tap response such as instead of one tap to increase volume you can change it to two taps. Charge is exactly as stated lasts a long time.
Cons: unfortunately the cons outway the pros. DOES NOT STAY IN EAR WHEN YOU MOVE. If you want to use these in a cubical or laying down their fine. Start to move around and they start to fall out. Can't change the tips much to anything bigger which came with it or it doesn't sit in the charger. I've tried buying different tips but nothing works. If they won't stay in their useless. Everything I try to adjust them back in my ear it wants to open Spotify (which I don't use) and is annoying.
I was so hopeful about these but now I regret buying them. If you looking for long last battery life, great sounds and control as long as they stay in your ear these are NOT what you want. Look elsewhere. So sad."
So far they sound great. Nice and clear sound. Decent bass. App has an adjustable eq so you can fine tune. Charges fairly quickly. Had multiple different brands and never had an issue with skullcandy. Hoping they deal well with every day wear and tear.
These are worth the price. Whether using as earphone or with noise cancelling. Work amazing.
I’ve used Apple AirPods for yearssss now and I and super impressed with the skull candy Rail ANC. I probably won’t ever go back to Apple ones and the app is super easy to use and I love how easy you can customize these to your personal liking I give it a 10/10!
"The sound is awesome, the battery life is awesome, the ANC works really well. But these are so uncomfortable with a conch piercing I'm going to have to have to return these. I can't wear them for more than 20 minutes at a time in my right ear. The touch controls are also super sensitive so I adjust them and it pauses."
Alta calidad... Original... Llego en buen estado funciona correptamente... Recomendado 100%
I got these for my son and he really likes them. I also tried them and thought the sound quality was pretty good and the anc pretty good. They're not spectacular and I was kinda hoping for more as my other son has some Skullcandy headphones and the bass on them is incredible.
Well tell you the truth it says it has options in my knowledge this sounds like skullcandy rail was exciting
"This has been the best Bluetooth that I've found that is clear, ppl can hear you without background noice"
"So I have noise canceling rail, buds, and non-noise canceling rail buds. They’re both really good the non-noise canceling ones. I got on a huge discount on their website. So I grabbed them. You’ll rarely find the noise canceling ones on sale so just beware of that because I thought I was ordering noise canceling and I was not.

These are noise canceling your ears really really good. I move around a lot. I talk a lot and earbuds. Just do not stay in my ears. I have a weird shaped ear I guess. They don’t stay in my ears no matter what and these do and they work really good!

Keeps the charge really really good. I’ve charged mine like twice since I’ve got them and I’ve had them for well over a month."
Decent headphones but no matter which ear piece you put in they would just slide out. They’re good if you’re just sitting around but nothing active at all.
One of the ears is out of power 20% of the times I go to use these. Probably connection issues in the case. Not a fun problem.
"Pretty disappointed in these, as they are literally a downgrade in almost all metrics from the Indy ANCs I have had previously. Sound quality seems fine, but that's about it. MANY connection issues including; The earbuds not pairing correctly sometimes, The earbuds will not disconnect or shut off when put in the pod, if the pod is not charged. The touch controls seem to require a random amount of touch/force to activate each time(sometimes a brush of hair will trigger it, sometimes a full pressed finger won't). The list goes on.
Most of this could be excused, or at least justified by the relatively inexpensive price, except I have owned two different pairs of the previous model the Indy ANC and neither of them had these problems.

TLDR: Worse product than the previous iteration for the same money. Womp womp."
I love them largest drivers in the earbud market
"I have the first Rail earphones, and I purchased these to check them out. Soundwise, these are solid, and I like how they fit. If you can swap the ear tips for foam, you will get a much better sound and fit.

The ANC and transparency are sub-par. I have similar-priced Jlab earphones with ANC and transparency that do a better job. I also have the Beats+ earphones, which are top-level on ANC and transparency.

Although I like how they sound and fit, their main advertised feature, active noise cancellation, is not their most robust feature. Future firmware upgrades could make them better. These are all right, but buyer beware - preferably buy if on sale."
"Never knew I had sensitive ears, but had a reaction to these. Switched out the soft in your ear part 3 times with the same result. They work good"
Just awesome
Decent play time. They could be louder sensitive to the touch they disconnected or stop playing when you adjust them in your ears. Don't love them don't hate them.
"I was pretty taken off guard by all the features these had compared to cheaper older earbuds I've had, the features and everything are great, good sound quality. The only complaint I have is that the noise cancelation, ambient sound setting, and regular earbuds sound setting all sound exactly the same for some reason which was honestly a bit of a bummer because I got these earbuds for that feature specifically but whatever they're nice. They also look pretty cool."
"I've used airpods pros 2 for a while and decided to try these out, these sound very close to those but with more bass and a really fun app. These are some of the best headphones I've had and will definitely be my pick from now on"
"Love these headphones! I didn't want to break the bank, but also wasn't trying to find something cheap. These are perfect midrange headphones that have a great bit of customizable sound settings in the app!"
"I wanted to try this pair of earbuds because I owned the skullcandy crushers. Because I like BASS! The earbud has amazing bass and good sound quality. The ANC is not the best but does the job well enough. The worst part for me though, it gave me a scab in my inner ear. Proving that the product quality isn't made of the best materials as only certain earbuds do this to me. For example, the Beats studio pro earbuds also did this to me. Not sure why, something to do with the plastic pieces being exposed instead of being covered by a silicone covering of some sort. The next bad thing is that these eabuds will pick up alot of background noises when in a call. But for the price, Skullcandy made a clever little product that stands out with its design and brings that BASS low ends to life!! That's why people usually buy Skullcandy, in my personal perspective, to be able to hear the bass. Lol."
They sound great and fit great but sometimes disconnects randomly. They don’t really do much as far as noise canceling but for the price they are alright. Giving 4 stars out of 5 just because Active Noise Canceling is part of the name and it doesn’t do it very well.
"I was impressed right away by the high frequency sound from this headset, rivaling my earbuds, the bass was also very good, the best I have heard from a bone conduction headset.
The controls were simple to remember and operated easily, I very quickly got so used to their feel and position that I was using them with hardly even thinking about it.
The fit was acceptable, I wear glasses with titanium bow pieces and the headset was comfortable around my ears even with my glasses on (I think it might be more of a problem for those who have thicker plastic bows). They are just a hair tighter on the neckband than my other bone conduction headset, still comfortable, but noticeable when I look up high. I am an inch or two over 6 foot tall and wear a size 18 shirt, a person any bigger than me might not like the fit of this headset.
The battery life was great, I wore them all day long on a testing day using them for music and phone calls actively almost all the time and did not run out of battery. I am sure I got my 10 hours of actual use and more from the battery charge. The headset dropped connection and would not reconnect shortly after it said 10% charge, There was no audible low battery warning, I lost my connection a little premature to that point or there is no audible function like many of my other Bluetooth audio devices.
The MP3 mode for stored audio files to the headset is great for activities where you are unable to carry your phone with you, for myself I will normally use the headset streaming music and calls from the phone. I do like the feature, but will only make use of it on occasion.
The headset was decent for me to use while mowing. A pair of silicone earplugs to detune the mower noise and I was able to hear music and audiobooks fairly easily over the mower noise (my mower does make a little less noise than many).
Overall I am very satisfied with the quality of audio, the construction is very good. The operation is better than average and the fit/comfort is very good outside perhaps those who fit the notations earlier. I rate this headset to be on par with the majority of top-level bone conduction headsets available at the time of this writing."
"I've fallen in love with these headphones. They've seamlessly integrated into my everyday routine, so much so that their presence often escapes my notice. The design is not only sleek but also secure, ensuring they stay in place throughout my activities. The control buttons are intuitively placed, making it a breeze to switch tracks, adjust the volume, and even access the internal MP3 player.

The Bluetooth coverage is impressively extensive. While these headphones don't offer active noise cancellation, they're designed to keep you connected to your surroundings, a feature that's essential for safety, particularly for women who need to be aware of their environment.

I wholeheartedly recommend these headphones to anyone who prioritizes comfort, functionality, and the ability to maintain situational awareness in a bustling world."
"As someone who uses noise cancelling headphones, I was very skeptical about these headphones and if they would actually suit my needs. These headphones work great for yard work and any outdoor needs.

A few talking points about these headphones.

Sound Quality: I was not expecting audiophile levels of base and quality from these headphones. You will not get that with these. If you are looking for noise cancellation these headphone do not have that feature so do not purchase these if that is something you cannot do without. I will say that these headphones are good enough to have some tunes to jam out to while doing yard work or anything where awareness of your surroundings are needed. The volume of these headphones worked fine for my needs and did not need to be adjusted past safe levels unless I was in a very noisy environment. These headphones will also work in situations where you need to hear whats going on around you if you are out for a jog or walking. There is no way to adjust any sound options like an equalizer and frankly they don't need one. I was quite satisfied with the audio quality from these headphones. The buttons used to power on the device and

Comfort and fit:
When first trying these on They are very lightweight and comfortable as advertised. No pressure on my ears or the side of my head. My only complaint is that when you look upwards and side to side they seem to be a little small for my head. My Fiance on the other hand does not have this issue. (I guess I just have a big head haha) But when I was engaged in activities that required me to face forward or do limited head movements these worked great. I would only suggest the manufacturer think about different sizes of bands or make them somewhat adjustable. The way these headbands are made do not adjust in size but will adequately accommodate hair and Reading Glasses/Sunglasses with no issue.

Bluetooth connectivity: I had no issue with this device staying connected to my phone. Many other headphones that I have bought specifically for outdoor use tend to lose connection when my phone is in my back pocket or when I turn my head a certain angle. I had no issues with that at all.

Water Resistance: I did not drop these in water or do anything crazy to test this feature but I can say that I sweat a great deal when I am doing things outdoors. This pair of headphones had no problems from getting drenched in sweat.

Charging Cable: The provided charging cable was very long and I didn't expect to get one like this. Many devices now only come with tiny charging cables. The cable can be used with any adaptive charging block and they magnetically connect to the headphones with little issue.

I cannot speak for the on board storage because I typically use spotify or another music streaming service.

Still I would suggest anyone looking for a good set of headphones for yard work and outdoor exercise to give these a shot."
"I got these headphones because the ones that go into my ear always slide out when I sweat. I was not sure about these because they made no connection with the ear, but technology moves forward and I thought I would give them a try.

What I like:

Super lightweight
Easy to setup - did not even have to read the instructions
Superb sound although the bass can tickle the area underneath the ear they reside
You can hear the surrounding sounds around you if needed but easily tune them out also
Battery life is great so far I have listened for several hours without having to charge them

What I thought could be improved but not a big deal:

If you have a big head after a while they can start to hurt. But it was after a couple of hours listening so not enough to downgrade rating.
The charger is not universal so you have to use the one included and it has to be just right to charge but it does have a magnet to help secure in place.

I am glad I got these I use them all the time now and when I walk or work out in the yard they do not move at all."
"The DEMICEA Open Ear Sport Headphones are a game-changer for fitness enthusiasts and audiophiles alike. These wireless bone conduction earphones offer a unique listening experience that keeps you aware of your surroundings while delivering crisp, clear audio. With a built-in 32GB MP3 player, you can store thousands of songs directly on the device, perfect for those long runs or gym sessions where you want to leave your phone behind.

The IP68 rating ensures these headphones can withstand intense workouts and unpredictable weather, while the 8-hour battery life keeps the music going through even the most grueling training sessions. The latest Bluetooth 5.3 technology provides a stable, lag-free connection when you do want to pair with your phone.

What really sets these headphones apart is their comfort and versatility. The open-ear design eliminates the discomfort of in-ear buds, allowing for extended wear without fatigue. Whether you're running, cycling, or hitting the weights, these headphones stay securely in place.

The built-in microphone is a welcome addition, allowing for clear hands-free calls on the go. Overall, the DEMICEA Open Ear Sport Headphones are an excellent investment for anyone seeking a durable, feature-packed audio solution for their active lifestyle."
"LOVE these headphones. They are extremely lightweight with a long lasting battery that charges quickly. They are comfortable – no screwing into your ear like airbuds, and far more secure (I have had airbuds fall out quite often, depending on what I am doing) I have all sorts of headphones for various purposes, but these fill a gap for my needs. They aren’t for everyone. They are not noise-cancelling and they don’t cover your ear to allow you to escape the world. What they are is perfect for working out, walking, running or just wandering along the beach, and still be aware of what's going on around you. The sound quality is quite good, and the controls are simple.
They can connect through Bluetooth to your devices for music or phone calls (very simple straightforward linking), but my favorite part is they have a built in 32GB MP3 player which is tiny and holds all the control buttons for the headphones, so there is no need to carry your phone (which are quite bulky these days!) I listen to audio books while walking (again – perfect for the beach because you can leave the phone behind).
The MP3 is simple – no playlists, just play/next/previous using buttons, so switching between my book or music is a bit awkward but I’m not complaining – just having the built in MP3 is a huge plus for me.
One thing to note – the charging/download cable is USB with a magnetic connection to the headphones, so yet another cable to keep and one you will only be able to replace through the headphone company. So far, no issue for me, but if I ever lose or forget the cable I’ll be bummed out.
Like I said, no headphones are perfect for all uses, but these have filled a void for me that no other headphones I have fills. Yay :>"
"Overall, I’ve been using it for running, and pleasantly surprised by the quality of sound. It’s a pretty good headphone, open ear, does exactly what it’s supposed to do, and for what it is, not super expensive.

Biggest issue is mainly the charging situation, which has a really flimsy and very cheap charger, And it’s a specialty one which means it’s not interchangeable.

I do wish it was a USB-C or something like that with a dust cover/rubber cover."
"These headphones are one of my favorites, and I've used numerous including brand 'S' and brand 'B'. What makes these special?

First and foremost they have really good sound for bone conduction headphones. There is a slight tradeoff in sound quality compared to typical earbuds but this is offset by the fact they are water resistant. One thing to keep in mind in this regard is they do have a proprietary charging cable. You might ask why? Well it's because that helps to maintain the water resistance. It would be impossible to waterproof a typical micro USB connector. The built in memory allows me to have my music in environments where I wouldn't want to haul my cell phone around (like the pool) or might be out of Bluetooth range.

Fit and comfort are great. There is light clamping pressure which you need with bone headphones that project sound in front of each ear. This allows me to hear most everything that's going on around me (because my ear canals are not obstructed at all). One of the most hazardous situations in public are all those people that tune out and wear earbuds or headphones. Bone conduction headphones for the most part eliminates that hazard.

For walking, cycling and such these are perfect. The band does stick out from the back of my head a bit so lying down or reclining back in a chair might be limited.

The microphone on these works great. All calls I've made resulted in a crystal clear connection and no one has had any issues understanding what I was saying. That's something I can't say about my brand 'B' open ear headphones.

I've used these for numerous hours and never ran out of juice. Another thing I can't say about my brand 'B' or 'S' earbuds.

Lastly I did have a self inflicted issue and the manufacturer went out of their way to help. Great product, great product support and a great safety device keeping me aware and in my music. An easy 5 stars."
"I have had these headphones for about two weeks and used them for about 60 hours of playtime. (6 hours at the water park being submerged repeatedly)

Pros:
Waterproof/Water use - these headphones are best used for swimming or water activities that will require you to have your head submerged. I repeatedly swam with the headphones and submerged my head and was amazed how clear the music was underwater. While above water, it was hard to hear the music as ambient sounds were bleeding through the music. If you are looking for headphones to utilize while swinging or at the water park these are it!

MP3 feature - The MP3 feature is quite interesting. I don’t have a big catalog of MP3 files available but what I do have was uploaded onto the headphones. I was able to play music without my phone which can be a plus when swimming or running. I almost prefer to preload music onto the headphones to allow for flexibility to not use my phone when situations require. 32 GB is small but capable of loading more than enough music to keep you going for the duration of the battery life.

Connectivity - I was able to maintain a BT connection at about 20-25 feet in an open space (no walls or interference). This BT connection was hindered at the same distance when submerged under water. I would switch to the MP3 function at that time. If you have your phone in a waterproof bag on your person, then you should be fine and not have any issues with this.

Battery life - I was able to get about 6 hours of playtime at about 100% volume 4 days in a row. Charging was about 2 hours from <20% batter to 100%.

Wearability - Confortable and great for extended use. I did not find them to move excessively while exercising (running and swimming) and were great while underwater. I found myself loving how they fit and felt during use.

Negative:

Charger - its a proprietary charger cable. No universal charger is available which is annoying. It also feels fragile. Might need to be replaced sooner than later.

Sound quality - This is where I believe people’s expectations are not rooted in the capabilities of these headphones. These headphones excel in a water setting. Conduction headphones are not good at daily use as ambient noise drown out the sound provided by these headphones. I found myself at 80+% volume to make out what the music or sound I had playing. This is amplified in public settings. It does allow for spacial awareness and surroundings so if you do need to be present (security or public duties) it can be a game changer.

Overall:

These headphones are best used for swimming activities or actives that would require you to be aware of your surrounding while still having the ability to listen to music or videos. They battery life won’t get you through a full day of listening without charging if used during an 8 hours shift as I found myself turning up the volume to 80+% to be able to make out what the music was. I did love how they fit and feel after prolonged use. I would recommend these headphones overall for swimmers or runner. I would not recommend these for people who want to immerse themselves in music as these are not intended for audiophiles who want high quality audio."
"I love a good audio book but while with a baby and toddler I don’t like to have headphones in, so I found these and love them! I can still hear baby cries or toddler getting into mischief while listening to a audio or even soft music!
They connected to my phone easily and so far I’ve used for a nonstop listen a whole day.
I wear them with glasses and even my hair up in a clip with no issues, and I was worried about how thin the wrap around was but so far they are durable, even had little hands that can’t help but bend them and no breaking so far! I can barely feel them once on and the sound is great for me and I don’t have to worry about my ears with these! Thus far I love them and definitely will be my go to listening device from now on!"
"My husband lost his central vision last year and needs his computer to read to him. He’s also hard of hearing. I bought him an expensive bone conduction headset and it worked well for him, and I could read without hearing his computer. I bought a $20 knockoff set for him to try, but the sound quality wasn’t nearly as good.

I bought this set for myself at a fraction of what his cost and had him try them for a full day. He said the clarity is just as good, and he liked them.

I started using them to listen to library audiobooks and love them. I can work inside and out while listening, and still hear what is happening around me. They are comfortable enough for all-day wear and don’t hurt like earbuds. I’ve been checking the battery usage and they last longer than a full day’s use, as do my husband’s, so I charge them while we’re sleeping. I charge them in a room other than where our devices are kept and think that helps maintain the batteries as turning Bluetooth on and off isn’t something my husband can do."
"Switching to these open-ear headphones was a game-changer for my workouts. The non-slip design keeps them securely in place, even during my most intense sessions. I can't rave enough about the comfort; it's like they were tailor-made for my ears, with no ear blockage from sweat and a feather-light feel that lets me forget I'm even wearing them. The 32GB storage is a godsend for those phone-free runs, and the battery life is impressive.

The sound quality is crisp and clear, though it takes some getting used to with the bone conduction technology. I love that I can stay aware of my surroundings while jamming to my tunes. The IP68 rating is the cherry on top, giving me the confidence to take these babies through any weather without a second thought.

One quirky tip for new users: give them a quick once-over with a dry cloth after each use to keep them in tip-top shape. And for those looking for an audio upgrade without the bulk, these are a fantastic choice. Just don't expect to hide your workout tunes from the world—they're definitely meant for personal enjoyment!

Overall, these headphones have won me over with their blend of advanced tech, comfort, and practicality. They're not just a pair of headphones; they're my workout wingmen."
"Let's get right off the bat. These are water resistant bone conducting headphones for cheap. By nature, these aren't going to be the most amazing things you've ever heard. There's a reason that the standard for bone conducting headphones cost upwards of $150-200. That said, for just $70-80, these are a great bargain! I primarily use them for listening to YouTube videos or podcasts while cleaning or working on some other project. Being bone conductive makes it really easy for me to hear what I'm working on and still enjoy the full range of sound from my media. The build quality is decent. Plastic and rubber throughout to help with water resistance. The headband is a bit loose on my head but doesn't seem to cause any issue with sound quality or comfort. I've worn them for a few hours at a time and seemed to have no issue. They do bleed sound a fair bit when not worn, so keep that in mind for those with noise sensitive roommates or partners. Additionally, the ability to add MP3s to the onboard storage and play without a device is particularly handy when exercising or working when not near a phone. Very nice. Overall, a good buy."
"This is my first time ever to have a ""Bone Conduction"" headphone. It is truly a wonderful new experience for me! Its crystal-clear sound quality impressed me a great deal. It is also very comfortable to wear. I have been using earphones for years including Apple's AirPods Pro while I am doing housework or weekly long-distance running, but these airphones are not comfortable to wear for a long time, especially in the hot summertime or when I am running and sweating.

Another disadvantage for airphones is when I wear in both ears, they block other outside sounds, making me unable to hear what is going on surrounding me, which is very inconvenient and sometimes not safe. Even the fancy and expensive Apple products with ""Transparency"" feature could not satisfactorily overcome this. But with this ""bone conduction"" open ear design, the above issue is gone! It's like I had an addition set of ears!!!

In addition, the design of the earpieces and charges are both very functional and elegant. The price for such a quality piece of highly used ""must-haves"" is on the low side, make this particular model a truly good deal on the amazon platform.

Highly recommended if you are like me, active in running and other sports or doing a lot of housework or yardwork.

I am sure if anyone ask me about buying new headphones, I will give my highest recommendation"
"I've found my new go-to headphones for tranquil spaces. Whether I'm nestled in the quiet of my home office, lost in the shelves of a library, or seeking solace amidst the bustle of the workplace, these headphones are a match made in heaven. The sound clarity is impressive, delivering every note with precision, making them perfect for concentration and enjoyment.

Previously, my daily headphones would leave me with tender spots from prolonged wear, but these have been a breath of fresh air. The design is thoughtful, distributing weight evenly and sparing my ears from the discomfort I used to endure. It's not just the absence of pain but the presence of pleasure in wearing them that has won me over.

Not only do they offer a comfortable fit, but their sleek and stylish appearance has also become a conversation starter. They've seamlessly integrated into my daily wardrobe, adding a touch of elegance to my look without compromising on functionality.

I wholeheartedly recommend these headphones for those who value comfort as much as sound quality and are looking to make a style statement. They've certainly earned a permanent spot in my collection."
"I've been using these headphones for quite some time now, and they continue to perform exceptionally well. They are definitely worth the recommendation. I purchased them as a birthday gift for my mom, and she absolutely loves them. She enjoys wearing them while doing household chores, and the Bluetooth range is more than sufficient for her needs.

The headphones have proven to be a reliable companion, offering good performance and excellent value for money. The quality is top-notch, and the after-sales service is also a guarantee, which gives me peace of mind. The product's durability and the brand's commitment to customer satisfaction make it a great choice for anyone looking for a reliable and affordable audio solution.

I highly recommend these headphones to anyone in search of a high-quality, user-friendly, and budget-friendly option that won't compromise on performance or service."
"This is my first experience in bone conductive. Knew about it for years but haven't had much of a want/need recently.

Being able to hear conversations openly is a huge advantage to this headset which was one of my main reasons why I wanted one of these. Another is on-ear or over-the-ear type headphones make my ears warm. I generally don't like that warm ear feeling after a few hours of use which these help with.

Package includes your general headset and magnetic charger attachment which can plug into a usb port on your computer to transfer music (did not need or test) but bluetooth pairing was a cinch with the included instructions.

Overall, happy with purchase"
"08SEP24 So this is my first set of Bone Conductive HeadPhones. With that being said. I went with a pair a bit more expensive(still not expensive) and with a better rating then super cheap ones to give this concept a real chance. I'm glad I did, I am surprised at the sound quality (I had my doubts). I can have the volume less than halfway and hear everything perfectly clear and better than with earbuds. They sound great, connected to my phone very easily, and they are comfortable. Working in the garage my ear buds start to itch my inner ears or start to be painful after about an hour, not these. I have yet to download music and/audio books to them to listen offline but I'm looking forward to it and will update revieear buds."
"I bought a shozk before, but the shozk broke after the warranty period. I might as well buy a cheaper one , and can buy two colors and change the straps. This color is more beautiful. Moreover, its Bluetooth connection is better than shozk. To cancel pairing, you only need to press the plus sign four times. Unlike shozk, you have to press the button at the same time, turn on and off, and charge to switch the device and search for Bluetooth. This is the right choice. Although there is a difference, I think the difference is not big. Just buy it and it is enough."
"Its waterproof is good, and the bone conduction earphones have good sealing. I bought the air conduction earphones before. When running, sweat will be sucked into the holes and cause sound distortion. I have to shake the water out of the earphones frequently. Although the sound quality of bone conduction headphones is not as detailed as that of air conduction, practicality is more important when running. It will not fall off when you wear it, and you can pay attention to the surrounding environment. The magnetic charging design interface only needs to be wiped dry in time after exercise. That's it, I like it."
"I received the headphones I was thinking about. The logistics is very fast. I have always wanted a pair of headphones that can be worn for sports. Ordinary in-ear headphones are easy to fall off, and the ears become sore and swollen after being worn for a long time. They are also easy to sweat and get dirty. These headphones are really good. It is a conscientious work. Bone conduction headphones put no pressure on the ears, and the sound quality will not be lost no matter how much you exercise. The sound effect is good. Thumbs up!"
"This size is perfect for me. My head is very round, so it fits me perfectly. A larger size will give me less pressure, making it comfortable for me to wear all day long. Although silicone is closer to the skin, this material is cooler than silicone after sweating and it won’t peel off the paint like openrun pro 2 after being used 6 weeks.
The adjustment function of the headphones is very convenient, and the volume adjustment and track switching are smooth. It’s also very convenient to press the button to have and end calls"
"This is my 2nd bone conducting headphones. My 1st is Shokz Openrun Pro which I sent back for RMA.

Even though I don't have much experience with bone conducting headphones, here is what I like about this product over Openrun pro:

It can get must louder.
Wearing and taking off is easier - with Openrun pro, unless I push up from the bottom, it was very difficult to remove.
Built-in 32GB memory - without using the phone for music player, I can listen to the music which is a great feature. However, the transfer speed (with default setting - for faster removal) was between 300K and 400K which could have been better with faster chip.
Higher IP-rating. With IP68 rating, I feel confident using these in any weather condition.

What I personally think it could be improved:
Power button seems to be harder to press than other 2 buttons.
Hard plastic body - when I put these down, it sounds like they hit the table hard - rubber coating could make it feel a little nice.
Audio quality - little more BASS sound may have been better.

So far, I really like these. I hope to use these for a long time."
"For me, whether it's running, cycling, or mountain climbing, music is an indispensable ""buff"" in outdoor sports. In actual wear experience, the design level is very high. The weight distribution and balance are well controlled, and when worn, the ear feels almost no sense of falling. During sports, there is no need to worry, the headphones can be firmly fitted to the head contour, and even in intense exercise, they can maintain stability, and there is no need to worry about displacement or falling off. This excellent fit not only enhances the user's sports experience but also ensures the stable output of sound quality. Although the overall sound quality of open headphones may not be as delicate as in a quiet indoor environment, it still maintains a satisfactory performance level."
"This is the best headphones for me. I love how you can hear when people approaching you, especially from behind. This way I can listen to my music or favorite tunes and not get run over from behind. You can hear others approaching, so you will not have that scare of surprise when a bike flies by. The sound is amazing and it is so easy to pare. I highly recommend these for anyone! You will love them!"
"UPDATE** I’ve used these headphones about 8 days, now I’m having the issue of them randomly shutting off after roughly 15 minutes every time. Super disappointed in this given what I paid for them.****

I work in a factory with an avg of 70-80 dB. This hold up so well and last roughly 7 hours on a full charge. I had a pair of aftershocks and these compared are pretty similar. Only downfall is looking for a back up charger for these and haven’t been able locate one yet. Only gave it 4 stars cause of this issue."
I am not an audiofile but these things sound as good to me as my son’s that costed twice as much. Be sure to fiddle around with the EQ. I thought it’d be nice to have a second charger so I wouldn’t be bound to carrying the one back and forth but couldn’t find one listed anywhere. I tendered an email query about how I might purchase an additional charger wire - no reply. A week later one shows up in my mailbox! How great was that?
"1This Bluetooth headset has an excellent memory connection feature, which automatically connects after being paired, eliminating the need for complicated setup procedures.
2Enjoy the freedom of long-distance connections and the convenience of fast data transmission; this Bluetooth device makes music and calls smoother and unobstructed.
3To ensure long-term use of the headphones, the seller recommends drying the charging port promptly after the headphones get wet, keeping it clean and preventing water intrusion.
4The endurance of these headphones is enough to meet daily use needs, without the need for frequent charging, ensuring your music experience is uninterrupted.
5With waterproof features, these headphones maintain stable performance whether you're sweating or caught in the rain; just remember to dry the charging port promptly."
"I really like these headphones because of one simple thing. They actually fit my head! I have the hardest time finding headphones that don't fall off every time I move my head so thank you!!
Secondly, these are so easy to operate, just push the power button and voila they're on and ready to go. The sound is amazing too! My husband likes these because I can be listening to my podcast but still hear him if he talks to me. They seem really durable too because I've dropped them several times and accidentally laid on them the other night and they're still clear as a bell and didn't break.
I highly recommend these!"
"I used these at the pool when I was doing laps. There's a learning curve to using the buttons, but once you learn them, it works well. In fact, it wanted to pair with my phone and it was in my pool bag probably 15 feet away! I ripped some CDs awhile ago and had them on a thumb drive, so transferring music was easy. I have an old desk top with a CD drive at work, so I plan to to put more music on these and use them when exercall winter. Holds a charge fairly well. I can also talk to people with them on, but usually don't. So far a great purchase so I don't drain my phone battery!!"
"I like these better than my old Shokz; they're lighter, sound just as good, are lighter and can act as mp3 player.

The only negative is that they shut the speakers down when the playback sound is too low. When I'm listening to podcasts if there is a momentary lull in the conversation the speakers shut off and then kick back on when there's talking again. This would be fine except the sound doesn't kick back on immediately, so you miss the first syllable or so and it can get really choppy at times. This effect is worse when the volume is set low so I find myself listening to things louder than I want to. Is there a way to shut this feature off?"
"Headset is amazing! In receipt of replacement of headset as first purchase appeared to be used based on packaging, at first disappointed as it fit better than one I had lost, but received replacement very quickly and it was packaged as new, sound quality is great, the on off sound is not too loud for me, I do wish you could get an extra charger but that's not a reason to give it less than 5 stars!"
"I was introduced to bone conduction headphones a couple of years ago and I've been wearing them frequently ever since. When one of my old pairs physically broke (I'm not particularly easy on them) I decided to give these a try. At time of writing, I've been wearing them for a couple hours per day for 2 weeks.

The sound volume is great, the bass is great (for bone conduction) and the shape is great. They are comfortable and usable. I would even say the sound quality is better than others I have tried, and I find them comfortable and easy to use.

some other bone conduction headphones I've tried have media buttons on the side ear piece, which I have always felt was an unfortunate placement since I am prone to accidently using the media buttons to redial my last call while the headphones are in my pocket. These headphones, on the other hand, do not have independent media buttons. Instead, the volume buttons have a dual purpose. Single press to change the volume, double-press for next song (or redial). Personally, I think this is an improvement since I never use media buttons anyway, and I don't accidentally pocket dial my friends. Another win for these headphones.

Also these are a storage device for MP3s! I don't use it for MP3s, but it's convenient as a USB stick.

on the other hand, the charging situation leaves a lot to be desired. The USB port bespoke magnetic port. What's more is that I don't seem to be able to buy replacements for this special cable. This means when I run to work, I am unable to charge the headphones while I'm at work unless I carry the special cable with me. Also, whenever this cable inevitably breaks in the future, this will essentially disable the device. If you're going to do this, you should at least send a few cables in the package or sell additional cables on Amazon.

(edit)
I've been trying to figure out how to buy a backup cable, and I can't find them anywhere. This is really a fatal design flaw, so I'm changing my rating to 1 star. It hasn't broken yet, but I expect my headphones to stop working any day now when this cable breaks. What a ridiculous, and completely avoidable, design problem."
"I've been using these bone conduction headphones for a few weeks now, and I'm absolutely blown away. As an avid runner, I was tired of bulky over-ear headphones that constantly slipped off. These headphones are a game-changer!
The open-ear design is perfect for staying aware of my surroundings while enjoying my music. I can hear traffic and other potential hazards, which gives me peace of mind. The sound quality is surprisingly good, with clear vocals and decent bass. The battery life is impressive, lasting me through multiple workouts without needing a recharge.
The build quality is excellent, and they're comfortable to wear even for long periods. I've even used them in the rain without any issues. If you're looking for a pair of headphones that won't interfere with your active lifestyle, I highly recommend these!"
"So I want to give these a 5 star rating, but I'm hesitant to do that just yet just because they are new and to be honest I'm shocked they are working as intended. I wanted headphones that I could use while swimming, and well these show it in use this way in the seller images so I figured it was worth a shot. And shockingly they worked!
I'm able to swim and hear my music or podcast clearly. I'd say the sound and clarity actually improves a bit when my ears are just below the surface. Not sure why that is. I've used them multiple times over multiple days and they continue to work and power on without issue. I do rinse them off with fresh water after each swim.
One negative is that if I submerge my head entirely below the surface by an inch or so they pause. Not sure if that is intentional. As soon as I pick my head up to the water line they automatically start playing again. I tested this a bit and found that happens up to about three seconds of submersion. If I reach or exceed four seconds I have to hit the play button on the headphones when I come back up to the surface . No issues with playback or sound and I am able to swim laps with no issue, which is what mattered most.
The only other thing I wish would be that the back frame was a bit smaller. I have short hair and I guess my head size runs small. It is semi-flexible so I can get it to stay on without discomfort, but if a smaller band size was offered I would have opted for that."
"I've decided to repurchase this item because it truly stands out as an excellent product. The seller has gone above and beyond by creating a series of instructional videos to assist users in tackling any issues they might encounter while using the product. These videos are incredibly practical, enabling me to quickly get the hang of it. The thoughtful design of the product makes it very user-friendly, allowing me to stay aware of my surroundings whether I'm jogging outdoors or working in the office. Moreover, it boasts clear sound quality, free from noise, providing me with an enjoyable auditory experience. The comfortable fit means that even with prolonged use, there's no discomfort."
"These earphones are very stable on my head when working around our property and when working out. I enjoy listening to music while being active and was always bothered by ear buds falling out. These earphones stay in place and are comfortable. I had a call yesterday and the caller said that he could hear me clearly with the microphone. Ear buds are great for couch potatoes, these work great for active people."
"The MoonPanda open ear headphones work well for my lifestyle. I can listen to music and still be aware of my surroundings while walking or working. They have a great sound, and I used them mostly with my iPhone, since I usually have my phone with me, but I have also downloaded some of my favorite songs to the 32 GB of internal storage when I don’t have by phone. The three buttons allow me to easily pause, change sound, forward, etc., without pulling my phone out of my pocket.

The battery life is great and lasts about 9 hours before having to recharge. The headphones are very lightweight and sometimes I forget I have them on. I am an older person and like products I use to be easy and not complicated, and these headphones fix the bill.

The price was great, and I am very happy with this purchase."
"The DEMICEA X6 bone conduction headphones were delivered with impressive speed, arriving within just 48 hours of placing the order. They came in a neat package, complete with a charging cable. I'm particularly impressed with the solid build and the straightforward, user-friendly design. The headphones' contours are skillfully crafted to provide a snug and comfortable fit.

When it comes to performance, it's crucial to understand that bone conduction headphones cater to particular use cases and features. While they may not offer the highest level of sound quality for audiophiles, they shine in scenarios where you need to maintain situational awareness while listening to audio.

My wife, who has sensitive ears and often finds earbuds uncomfortable, finds the DEMICEA X6 headphones to be perfect. The design and fit of these headphones are well-represented.

In conclusion, the DEMICEA X6 bone conduction headphones stand out as an excellent choice for individuals who prioritize utility and comfort over cutting-edge sound fidelity."
"I love these headphones. They are great for working out and taking walks. It allows me to still hear outside activities which I really like for safety reasons. They are lightweight and do not hurt my neck or ear area. Charging is also fast. I won’t be using them for swimming but it’s great to know if I spill something on them, they won’t be damaged."
"Paired fast, as soon as I turned on my phones Bluetooth. The devices clarity is top notch. It has a wide range of volume, low to high, which when adjusted drowns out background noise. The controls are in a easy to use location. The charging point is a little awkward, but it's just a matter of getting use to. I also like, the head band which keeps it in place and it's over the ears versus in the ear canal. I'm loving it."
"If you, like me, value comfort and safety over ultimate sound quality, these headphones may be the ideal choice for you. They have provided me with significant convenience and improvement in work and outdoor activities.
They are easy to pair, with a good Bluetooth range, and have all the basic functions I need, such as power on/off, call answering, and playback controls. The battery life is satisfactory, and the magnetic charger is both convenient and durable. Although it's not universal, the seller offers a replacement service for the charger."
"This is my second pair of bone-conduction headphones. My first pair were Shokz. These are more comfortable and were ready to go out of the box. There are soft pads to hold them close to your ears. Pairing the first time was easy, but more importantly the second time I turned them on they paired with my phone right away. I have had pairing issues with other devices but this one seems to work particularly efficiently. I'm looking forward to taking these out on my next run."
"So far I’m really liking these. Sound is good, the mp3 works great but actually I mostly just carry my phone in a pocket bc I switch music so often. Have not tried underwater yet. Battery is great & the function buttons are easily accessible on the right behind ear. They also fit nicely & no problems when working out."
"I was looking for a replacement set of headphones and was curious about the bone conduction. What a great set of headphones. easy to use and to charge. I used them last night and was able to listen to the TV and the headphones without a problem. They are a quality product. The sound is awesome, including the bass level. Highly recommended."
"I used 2-3 bone conduction headphones of another brand before for road running. This Demicea X6 seems to have better sound, bit heavy but hanging very well. No problem for my excessive sweating and washing. So far so good. Let's see how long it can last."
I feel much safer listening to my music or audiobooks when I walk the dog. I can hear the cars around me and can make sure I am out of the way. It’s dirt roads without sidewalks where I live and not many cars or trucks……. but I need to be careful as the vehicles don’t expect a pedestrian on the road. The over ear is very comfortable and easy to set up with my iPhone. I am so glad that I purchased this.
"The simplicity of the button controls on these headphones is a breath of fresh air. One touch and I'm switching tracks or adjusting the volume without missing a beat. Comfort is key, especially during long listening sessions, and these headphones deliver with their plush ear cushions and a lightweight design that barely feels like I'm wearing them. The secure fit ensures they stay put, even during my most vigorous workouts. I also love the Bluetooth memory feature—it pairs seamlessly with my devices, saving me the hassle of reconnecting every time. A solid choice for both comfort and convenience."
"The bone conduction headphones are incredibly user-friendly with easy-to-operate buttons. They also feature an MP3 storage mode, which is a great bonus for music lovers. They are waterproof and sweat-resistant Without a doubt, it's important to note that they shouldn't be carelessly discarded after use. Wiping the charging port is a must to maintain their longevity. Even the most robust headphones can be damaged if they're submerged in water without caution. It's a small maintenance step that ensures these headphones continue to perform at their best. At least, everything is normal so far with what I've done."
"I bought it for running, and I was worry about it fall down when I run. But it is perfetc fit. The shape doesn't allow it to fall off your ears. The battery is perfect. I am using this for 20 minutes everyday. After three weeks the battery is still alive."
"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

The sound quality is good, lightweight, comfortable to wear, even during long listening sessions, plus, the battery pretty good! Overall, the build quality and performance make these headphones a fantastic value for the price. Highly recommended!"""
I have a small head so back loop was a little large and is uncomfortable reclining in chair. However I plan to use while walking or mowing with ear protection and it works great. Sound is loud and clear and connected to phone 1st try. Arrived on time which was much better than another brand that never arrived USPS. Holds 8 hour charge. Simple to use.
"I decided to test these out for a few days before i gave my opinions on them. I really like them. The sound quality is great. I can still hear my surroundings, but not in an intrusive way. I'm also very impressed with the battery life. I haven't had to charge it yet! They are very comfortable. That's a winning point for me because I have small ears and earbuds aren't always easy for me to wear. I fully recommend these!"
I bought this for a friend who is a fitness trainer. He has nothing but high praises. He describes it as having it on and not even feeling it. It says he only remembers that he's wearing it when his hands pass over it for some reason or another. He says I Is comfortable and works very well with his mobile device. He can go jogging in it and do all his sessions in it. Now I am in the process of ordering one for myself because I have issues with all the other earpieces I have ever tried. Nothing seemed to fit into my ear without falling out. Stay tuned for my review as soon as I recipe it.
"I was looking to get some bone conduction headphones to use for lap swimming and these fit the bill for that nicely. They've held up in the water perfectly and audio quality is sufficient for my needs. I find it useful that this model has Bluetooth functionality in addition to the mp3 player, making it more viable for more use cases outside the water."
"I have bought cheaper ones, but they really weren't as good as this one. In the end, I decided to keep this pair. I also bought another pair that was more expensive, but I didn't feel much difference between them. Plus, it didn't have as many color options as this one. I love this one; it's very suitable for me overall. It's lightweight, sounds great, comfortable, and eco-friendly."
"I had heard about these bone vibrating headphones and wanted to see what all the craze is all about. At first I couldn't understand why the speakers don't go over the ears, but once I figured out that you put it in front of your ears on this bone that vibrates your eardrums You can hear the speakers that way, without having your ears covered and being able to have conversations with people at the same time as listening to your music. A little weird to get used to but once you get used to it they are amazing. Mine are also waterproof and can be worn while swimming, but I wouldn't dive into the water with these on or risk losing them. Sound quality is not like the over the ear noise canceling headphones, but they are not designed for that, they are designed for you to listen to music or podcasts while still being able to hear everything going on at the same time.
I love using mine while I work so that I can still focus and hear what's going on at the same time listening to a good podcast.
Very comfortable to wear, after a while you don't even feel that they are on, I am overall happy with my purchase.
It came with 32 GB of internal storage, but I just stream the music through my phone. It would work if you downloaded your own music into the headphones and didn't connect to your phone."
I love them! I have to wear PPE for my job and these are amazing! They are approved in so many places of work and they are awesome in sound quality! Definitely recommend them to anyone who’s in the search of affordable bone headphones!
"As an electrician, I wear these every day. If I need to throw in earplugs, I can still hear my music and I have to worry about damaging my ears. These are must haves in the construction world."
"I purchased this product because ear buds hurt my ears and fall out often.
The bone conduction headphones rest next to your ear. No pain or discomfort. The sound quality is good. It is nice not having your ears plugged with ear buds. You can listen to music and still have a conversaton with someone."
"My little pup got a little too curious and chewed up my charging cable for the headphones. A big thank you to the after-sales service for promptly sending a replacement, resolving my issue without a hitch. I'm a fan of these headphones and really appreciate the support, allowing me to get back to my dog-walking tunes. My mischievous little dog might have caused some trouble, but the excellent service has me covered. Thanks for ensuring I can enjoy my walks with my furry friend once again!"
Bought these for my husband as he has a hard time with in the ear headphones. The fit was perfect for him . The open ear feature is great when he's working in the yard.
"I'm thoroughly pleased with these MoonPanda bone conduction headphones. I end up using these just as much as I do my in-ear headphones. The big plus with this is that they keep my ears from being obstructed and I can hear outside sounds. I'm able to use these also while swimming and showering, as they are waterproof. As with any bone-conducting headphones, you lose a little bit of sound/bass quality, but the quality on these is so good that I don't notice a terribly huge difference.

They are a great supplement to my in-ear headphones when aye I'm running or doing other work that I need to keep my ears available for other sounds or distractions and I might need to attend to.

I researched bone conduction headphones and they appear to be better to save your hearing since the sound does not directly hit the eardrums.

The charger is a quick magnet that keeps me from fumbling with the standard charger that needs to be plugged into the headphones or any charging case.

They are extremely well-built and sturdy. I can easily put them around my neck if I want to fully engage in a conversation. The three buttons allow me to easily pause, change sound, forward, reverse, answer phone calls, etc.

Phone call quality is great and I can hear others just as well as they report they can hear me. These are my new go-to for any outdoor activity as well as wearing around the house when I want to listen to music or podcasts but I also need to be attuned to conversations that are happening.

I can't say enough about the quality and sturdiness. These are not flimsy by any means. They can be twisted and flung without worrying about breaking them. The fit also seems perfect for anyone as they naturally fall to the right place they need to just outside to the front of the ear. I don't have any cons to report."
This was a great purchase. It fits around the head without falling down or moving when I move the grass. The sound is great and clear to hear the music as well as hearing other things around. It fits nice on the ear and I love I don’t have to keep adjusting it and my ears are never hurting.
"First set of bone conducting headphones, I gotta say, I like them a lot more than ones that go in the ear or cover the ear. These are far more comfortable to wear. The sound quality is great, and setting up was a snap."
These things work GREAT. I can hear what's going on around me while walking while also listening to podcasts or music. SUPER comfortable to wear. Best money Ive spent on headphones EVER.
"I’m not a purist when it comes to sound quality, but I cannot stand tinny, garbled or distorted sound. I don’t blast things super loud.
These headphones meet all my needs for music, phone calls and podcasts.
They fit securely on my head, I can hear traffic noise on my bike and the battery has lasted over 5 hours of continuous use.
The only “problem” is the charge cord. It is not a common one. Forgot to pack it for my trip. Ran out of battery on the trip home. My bad."
"The only thing I was worried about is the charging cable as it feels a little on the softer sight with a magnet to charge.
The sounds is 5 out of 5, the durability will be updated in 4 months.

Good purchase so far"
"I have always had problems with EarPods. They don’t fit right and they often fall out so I needed to find something that would work. I’m not a big fan of the normal headphones. These open ear headphones worked. Excellent they have great sound very, very comfortable They have great battery life and the fact that you can download music directly to them, makes them completely portable. These are the best headphones I have ever owned. I would definitely purchase again."
"Fit and comfort are great. Has really good sound quality. They are extremely lightweight with a long lasting battery that charges quickly. The battery life is great, I wore these daily for more than a week during my exercise sessions for music and phone calls and it did not run out of battery. The set up and pairing was easy and connected without any problem. The range is wonderful allowing me to move around throughout most of the house without phone in my pocket.

Overall I enjoy using this daily for my work calls and listening to background music while exercising or mowing the lawn."
"I wear these all night at work, 8-9 hours. More space for music than I'll ever use. Hundreds of songs fit on the drive. Paired easily with my phone, simple double click to switch to phone or back to music storage. Interface to transfer songs is a simple drag and drop window."
"With an IP68 waterproof rating, this headphone withstands rain and intense workouts without damage. You don’t have to worry about moisture even during heavy rain, making it perfect for unpredictable weather.
But In daily use, especially after exercising, it's important to wipe the charging contacts of your headphones to help maintain their healthy condition.
The open-ear design of this bone conduction headphone keeps your ears completely unobstructed, providing comfort even during extended use.
it deserves five stars."
"This is my first set of bone conduction headphones and I’m really impressed. The musical clarity is really good and they seem to be well built.

The controls are really easy to use and the magnetic charger is awesome. No more fiddling with a cable and plugging it in.

Overall, I’m extremely happy with these. Definitely recommended."
"I got it from my father and he really enjoyed it when he worked out. Also, he use it for swimming and he says it’s amazing headphones"
"These bone conduction headphones are fantastic for workouts! They stay in place during intense exercise, and I love that they allow me to hear my surroundings while still delivering clear audio. The sound quality is great, and they’re comfortable enough to wear for long periods. If you’re looking for headphones that are safe for outdoor activities and provide excellent sound, these are the ones to get."
"These are amazing. Light weight, sound is crystal clear, long lasting battery. Super comfortable. I wear them while working and often forget I'm wearing them due to being so light weight. I get about 7.5 to 8 hrs straight use before they have to be recharged."
"I just received it yesterday. Setting up the bluetooth was easy. I have put about 500 songs on it and am still testing it. So far it works as advertized. If you have the volume turned up, you do have to turn it down a bit to hear other things going on around you. The sound is actually pretty good, but not as good as normal headphones."
I absolutely love these bone conduction headphones! The earbud types were painful to use but these are painless! I also love that you are aware of your environment while using. The volume controls/on and off buttons are conveniently on the headphone itself. Easy to charge. Would purchase again for family.
"Needed to request a replacement and gladly I was given one. It works quite well. It’s sweat resistant and stays on your head at all times. May need to raise the volume higher than normal, but the sound is conducted by bone, so its safer in the end. Water proof, and sweat proof"
"I work in construction and in Florida. So with that being said. I sweat a lot. It is hard to find something that is sweat/waterproof. There are some products out there that say it's waterproof or sweat proof but I try it and it's starts to malfunction and end up throwing it out.

This product has great sound quality and battery life is about 10 hrs on almost high volume. Buttons so far ar standing up to my work and seem very durable.

The weight of them is very light. At times I forget they are there Except for the music playing. The stability on your head is very good and don't feel like they are going to fall off your head.

I also choose the bone conduction head phone because after long periods of time the earbuds tend to irritate my ears where as these don't even enter your ear so there is no problem from that.

Great product."
"This set of bone conduction headphones performs better than the other two I tried.
Prompt delivery, well packaged, undamaged and easy to program.
I recommend this brand of headphones."
"I've had these headphones for two weeks and used them for about 45 hours, including 3 hours at the YMCA swimming pool.
These headphones are great for swimming or biking activities. Music sounds clear underwater, though it's harder to hear above water due to ambient noise.
MP3 Feature: The MP3 feature is handy. Even with a small catalog, I enjoyed not needing my phone while swimming or running. The 32 GB storage is enough for several hours of music, matching the battery life.
Connectivity: Bluetooth works well up to 20-25 feet in open spaces. Underwater, the connection weakens, so I switched to MP3 mode. Keeping your phone in a waterproof bag can help maintain the connection.
Battery Life: I got about 5 hours of playtime at full volume for 3 days straight. Charging from below 20% to 100% took about 2 hours with the magnetic propriety charger. which is annoying and feels fragile.
Wearability: Comfortable for extended use and stays in place while running and swimming. They fit well and felt great during use.
Sound Quality: These headphones excel in water settings. Bone conduction headphones are not great for daily use due to ambient noise. I needed to turn the volume to 80%+ to hear clearly, especially in public. However, they allow for spatial awareness, which is beneficial for security especially when walking at night with the dog, or swimming.
These headphones are best for swimming or activities where you need to stay aware of your surroundings. The battery won't last a full 8-hour shift if you keep the volume high. They fit well and are comfortable for prolonged use. Recommended for swimmers or runners, but not for those seeking high-quality audio."
"Really like these for being able to use them and talk and have conversation. They have great sound and are quite comfortable. Not sure on the battery life, but the charger is quick and easy to use. Would recommend"

I was surprised by the sound quality of the headphones. I also liked that they are lightweight and very comfortable. I spent a few hours wearing them and didn't feel any discomfort. I loved them!
"There is nothing to not like. It is is to charge, sync and use . Also, the price is affordable as well. I will make sure to refer others ."
Product is well made. Sound quality as expected with open ear headphone. Good bluetooth range to your device. The neckband look a little thin. Don’t know yet about the neck band’s durability. Only time will tell.
"I did a lot of research and didn't need all the features. Delivered quickly and fit great even with a hat. It is perfect for my main use inside. Great inside and in car for private listen to music AND still hear spouse, pet and/or alarms."
"Liked: Easy to wear. Easy pairing. Very functional for exercising. Sound quality and battery life excellent thus far.
Did not like the lack of operating instructions particularly for changing the headset."
I work on a job site that doesn’t allow headphones for safety reasons. These are a nice loophole to that rule that sound just as good as regular headphones. They also have a decent battery life.
I was very pleased with the quality of the sound and the lightweight feel of the head phones. They easily fit in my pocketbook so I take them everywhere.
As described. Simple and easy to use. The sound is good and has enough bass. I only wish it could be a little louder at max sound setting.
I bought these for my husband to wear at work with a hard hat. He is not allowed to wear ear buds at work for safety reasons but can wear these type of head phones and they work really well for him. They are comfortable and no slipping with sweat. He can listen to music and still hear what is going on around him. Battery life is great and music comes through clearly with no sound leakage. Perfect!!!
"Sound quality is superb, Bluetooth connection is easy and has a great fit"
"This is a fantastic headset, sound quality if perfect, battery is great phone calls awesome, if you're in to podcasts YouTube or movies This works flawless. And on top of all the price is very low compared to Shokz 3 times the price and this is better quality 👌."
The quality of sound is impressive. They fit comfortably lightly pressing against the temples. It stays in place while moving around and exercising. The controls are easy to operate while in place. My experience is that it has good range from the device coupled to.
Excellent quality for the price good clear sound good battery life easy to use
Fit was great. Very comfortable to wear and the sound was great.
I love my headphones. I workout with them. I swim with them. I even play pickleball with them. They fit great and have a good sound. What I love the most is the CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I had some questions that I emailed them. They immediately emailed me back with an answer. I didn’t even have to wait 24 hrs. I recommend these headphones. Especially if you’re active in sports.
"Very light, and sounds clear to hear. Love it so far."
